**You can use models to analyze and design software before you start coding.**

Suppose you are planning to implement a simple minesweeper game that has a text based UI and a GUI. Given below is a possible OOP design for the game.

Before jumping into coding, you may want to find out things such as,

* Is this class structure able to produce the behavior you want?
* What API should each class have?
* Do you need more classes?

To answer these questions, you can analyze how the objects of these classes will interact with each other to produce the behavior you want.
