Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the <tooltip content="the relevant information that needs to be examined to understand a problem">problem domain</tooltip> (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). **Class diagrams that are used to model the problem domain are called _conceptual class diagrams_ or _OO domain models (OODMs)_.**

{{ icon_example }} The OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.

Description: The snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.

**OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes** (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not usually in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.

**OODMs represents the class _structure_ of the problem domain** and not their behavior, just like class diagrams. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.

**OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but omit methods and navigability.**
