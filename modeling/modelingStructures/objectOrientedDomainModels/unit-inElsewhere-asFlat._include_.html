<p><strong class="text-info">Sidebar: Domain Modeling</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Domain modeling</em> is modeling the <tooltip><template #content>the relevant information that needs to be examined to understand a problem</template>problem domain</tooltip></strong> i.e., to model how things actually work in the real world. Domain modeling is useful in understanding the problem domain, which is essential to the success of a project.</p>
<p><strong>Domain modeling can be done using</strong>,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a <em>domain-specific</em> modeling notation</strong> if such a notation exists (e.g., a modeling notation specific to the banking domain might have elements to represent loans, accounts, transactions etc.),</li>
<li><strong>or a general purpose modeling notation</strong>, such as UML (e.g., you can use an activity diagram to model the workflow of processing a loan application),</li>
<li><strong>or even other general purpose notations</strong> (e.g., you can use an organization chart to model the employee hierarchy of a company).</li></ul></box>
<p>When building an OOP system, it makes sense to build OOP models of the problem domain, given OOP aspires to emulate the objects in the real world.</p>
<p><strong>The UML model that captures class structures in the problem domain are called <em>conceptual class diagrams</em>.</strong> They are in fact a lighter version of class diagrams, and sometimes also called <em>OO domain models (OODMs)</em>. The latter name is somewhat misleading as conceptual class diagrams (CCDs) are actually only one type of domain models that can model an OOP problem domain.</p>

<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The CCD of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
<p>Description: The snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p>

<p><strong>CCDs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e., classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not usually in a CCD because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
<p><strong>CCDs represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem domain</strong> and not their behavior, just like class diagrams. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
<p><strong>CCD notation is a subset of the class diagram notation (omits methods and navigability).</strong></p></div>

<p>(a)</p>
<p>Explanation: The diagram shows navigability which is not shown in a CCD. Hence, it has to be a class diagram.</p></panel></panel></div>

<p>(a)</p>
<p>Explanation: Both are UML diagrams, and use the class diagram notation. While it is true that often a class diagram may have more classes and more details, the main difference is that a CCD describes the problem domain while the class diagram describes the solution.</p></panel></panel></div></div></div></div></div></div>
