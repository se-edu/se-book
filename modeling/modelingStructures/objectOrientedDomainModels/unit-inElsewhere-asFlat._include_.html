<p>The analysis process for identifying objects and object classes is recognized as one of the most difficult areas of object-oriented development. <sub>--<a href="http://www.software-engin.com/">Ian Sommerville, in the book <em>Software Engineering</em></a></sub></p></blockquote>
<p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the <tooltip><template #content>the relevant information that needs to be examined to understand a problem</template>problem domain</tooltip> (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). <strong>Class diagrams that are used to model the problem domain are called <em>conceptual class diagrams</em> or <em>OO domain models (OODMs)</em>.</strong></p>

<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
<p>Description: The snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p>

<p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not usually in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
<p><strong>OODMs represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem domain</strong> and not their behavior, just like class diagrams. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
<p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but omit methods and navigability.</strong></p></div>

<p>(a)</p>
<p>Explanation: The diagram shows navigability which is not shown in an OO domain model. Hence, it has to be a class diagram.</p></div></template></question></panel></div>

<template #answer><div>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>Explanation: Both are UML diagrams, and use the class diagram notation. While it is true that often a class diagram may have more classes and more details, the main difference is that the OO domain model describes the problem domain while the class diagram describes the solution.</p></div></template></question></panel></div></div></panel></div></div></div></div>
