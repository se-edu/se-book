<div slot="answer">

~~(a)~~(b)(c)(d)(e)

Explanation:

(a) does not match because a `Snake` may or may not belong to a `Board` (multiplicity is `0..1`)<br>
(b) matches the diagram because the multiplicity given is `1`<br>
(c) matches the diagram because `SnakeHeadSquare` is a `Square` (due to inheritance)<br>
(d) matches the diagram because the multiplicity given is `*`<br>
(e) matches the diagram because the multiplicity given is `5`<br>
