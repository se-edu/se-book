* First, a cashier takes the order.
* Then, three workers start preparing the order at the same time; one prepares the drinks, one prepares the burgers, and one prepares the desserts.
* In the meantime, the customer pays for the order. If the customer has a voucher, she pays using the voucher; otherwise she pays using cash.
* After paying, the customer collects the food after all three parts of the order are ready.
