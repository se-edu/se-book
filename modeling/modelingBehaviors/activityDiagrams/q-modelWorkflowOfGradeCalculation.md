<question>

(a) Draw an activity diagram to represent the following algorithm used for calculating the grade of a student.

1. Read project score from keyboard
1. Read exam score from keyboard
1. Calculate the total
1. Calculate the grade
1. Print total and grade

(b) Update the activity diagram you drew above to also include the following logic that is used when calculating the grade.
* `A`: at least 25 marks for each component and at least 60 in total (for brevity, you can call this `condition-A` -- i.e., if `condition-A` is met, give grade `A`)
* `B`: at least one component has 25 or more marks and at least 50 in total (i.e., `condition-B`)
* `C`: otherwise


(c) Update the diagram you drew above to incorporate the following information.

* At the very beginning, ask the user how many grades need to be calculated.
* Repeat the whole grade calculation process for the number of times specified by the user.
