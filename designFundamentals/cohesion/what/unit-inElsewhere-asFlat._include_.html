        <p><strong><em>Cohesion</em> is a measure of how strongly-related and focused the various responsibilities of a component are.</strong> A highly-cohesive component keeps related functionalities together while keeping out all other unrelated things.</p>
        <p><strong>Higher cohesion is better.</strong> Disadvantages of low cohesion (aka <em>weak</em> cohesion):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lowers the understandability of modules as it is difficult to express module functionalities at a higher level.</li>
          <li>Lowers maintainability because a module can be modified due to unrelated causes <span class="dimmed"> (reason: the module contains code unrelated to each other)</span> or many many modules may need to be modified to achieve a small change in behavior <span class="dimmed"> (reason: because the code realated to that change is not localized to a single module)</span>.</li>
          <li>Lowers reusability of modules because they do not represent logical units of functionality.</li>
