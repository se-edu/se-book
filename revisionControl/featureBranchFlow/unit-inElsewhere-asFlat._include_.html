<p><strong><em>Feature branch</em> workflow is similar to forking workflow except there are no forks.</strong> Everyone is pushing/pulling from the same remote repo. The phrase <em>feature branch</em> is used because each new feature (or bug fix, or any other modification) is done in a separate branch and merged to the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>master</code> branch when ready. Pull requests can still be created within the central repository, from the feature branch to the main branch.</p>
<p>As this workflow require all team members to have write access to the repository,</p>
<ul>
<li>it is better to <em>protect</em> the main branch using some mechanism, to reduce the risk of accidental undesirable changes to it.</li>
<li>it is not suitable for situations where the code contributors are not 'trusted' enough to be given write permission.</li></ul>
