**The _repository_ is the database that stores the revision history.** Suppose you want to apply revision control on files in a directory called `ProjectFoo`. In that case, you need to set up a _repo_ (short for repository) in the `ProjectFoo` directory, which is referred to as the _working directory_ of the repo. For example, Git uses a hidden folder named `.git` inside the working directory, to store the database of the working directory's revision history.

**You can have multiple repos in your computer**, each repo revision-controlling files of a different working directory, for examples, files of different projects.
