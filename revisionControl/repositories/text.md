**The _repository_ is the database where the meta-data about the revision history are stored.** Suppose you want to apply revision control on files in a directory called `ProjectFoo`. In that case you need to set up a _repo_ (short for repository) in `ProjectFoo` directory, which is referred to as the _working directory_ of the repo.  For example, Git uses a hidden folder named `.git` inside the working directory.

**You can have multiple repos in your computer**, each repo revision-controlling files of a different working directly, for examples, files of different projects.
