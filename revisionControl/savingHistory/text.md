##### Tracking and ignoring

**In a repo, you can specify which files to track and which files to ==ignore==.** Some files such as temporary log files created during the build/test process should not be revision-controlled.

##### Staging and committing 

<tabs> 
  <tab header="{{ icon_text }}">

**==_Committing_== saves a snapshot of the current state of the tracked files in the revision control history. Such a snapshot is also called a _commit_ (i.e. the noun).**

**When ready to commit, you first ==_stage_== the specific changes you want to commit.** This intermediate step allows you to commit only some changes while saving other changes for a later commit.
