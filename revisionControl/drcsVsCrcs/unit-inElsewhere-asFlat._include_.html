<p><strong>RCS can be done in two ways: the <em>centralized</em> way and the <em>distributed</em> way.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Centralized RCS (CRCS for short) uses a central remote repo that is shared by the team.</strong> Team members interact directly with this central repository. Older RCS tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model.</p>

<p><em>The centralized RCS approach without any local repos (e.g., CVS, SVN)</em></p></pic><p></p>
<p><strong>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS) allows multiple remote/local repos</strong> working together. The workflow can vary from team to team.  For example, every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in the diagram below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support the distributed approach.</p>
