<p><strong><trigger for="pop:rcs">RCS</trigger> tools store the history of the working directory as a series of commits.</strong> This means you should commit after each change that you want the RCS to 'remember'.</p>
<p><strong>Each commit in a repo is a recorded point in the history of the project that is uniquely identified by an auto-generated <mark>hash</mark></strong> e.g. <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>a16043703f28e5b3dab95915f5c5e5bf4fdc5fc1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>You can <mark>tag</mark> a specific commit with a more easily identifiable name</strong> e.g. <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>v1.0.2</code>.</p>
<p><strong>To see what changed between two points of the history, you can ask the RCS tool to  <mark><em>diff</em></mark> the two commits in concern.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To restore the state of the working directory at a point in the past, you can <mark><em>checkout</em></mark> the commit in concern.</strong> i.e., you can traverse the history of the working directory simply by checking out the commits you are interested in.</p>
