      <p><strong><mark><em>Branching</em></mark> is the process of evolving multiple versions of the software in parallel.</strong> For example, one team member can create a new branch and add an experimental feature to it while the rest of the team keeps
        working on another branch. Branches can be given names e.g. <code>master</code>, <code>release</code>, <code>dev</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>A branch can be <mark><em>merged</em></mark> into another branch.</strong> Merging usually result in a new commit that represents the changes done in the branch being merged.</p>

        <strong>Branching and merging</strong></pic>
      <p><strong><mark><em>Merge conflicts</em></mark> happen when you try to merge two branches that had changed the same part of the code</strong> and the RCS software cannot decide which changes to keep. In those cases we have to ‘resolve’ those conflicts
        manually.</p>
