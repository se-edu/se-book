<p><strong><em>Branching</em> is the process of evolving multiple versions of the software in parallel.</strong> For example, one team member can create a new branch and add an experimental feature to it while the rest of the team keeps working on another branch. Branches can be given names e.g. <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>master</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>release</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>dev</code>.</p>
<p><strong>A branch can be <em>merged</em> into another branch.</strong> Merging sometimes results in a new commit (called the <em>merge commit</em>) being created, to represent the cumulative changes done in the receiving branch as a result of the merge.</p>

  <strong>Branching and merging</strong></pic>
<p><strong><em>Merge conflicts</em> happen when you try to merge two branches that had changed the same part of the code</strong> and the <trigger for="pop:rcs">RCS</trigger> cannot decide which changes to keep. In those cases, you have to ‘resolve’ the conflicts manually.</p></div>
