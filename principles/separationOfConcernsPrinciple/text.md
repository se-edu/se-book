A _concern_ in this context is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Examples for _concerns_:

*	A specific feature, such as the code related to the `add employee` feature
*	A specific aspect, such as the code related to `persistence` or `security`
*	A specific entity, such as the code related to the `Employee` entity

</box>

**Applying <tooltip content="Separation of Concerns">SoC</tooltip> reduces functional overlaps among code sections and also limits the ripple effect when changes are introduced to a specific part of the system.**

<box>

{{ icon_example }} If the code related to _persistence_ is separated from the code related to _security_, a change to how the data are persisted will not need changes to how the security is implemented.

</box>

**This principle can be applied at the class level, as well as at higher levels.**

<box>

{{ icon_example }} The <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:soc-nTier">n-tier architecture</trigger> utilizes this principle. Each layer in the architecture has a well-defined functionality that has no functional overlap with each other.
