    <p>While it is possible to isolate the functionalities of a software system into modules, there is no way to remove interaction between modules. When modules interact with each other, coupling naturally increases. Consequently, it is harder to localize
      any changes to the software system. The Open-Close Principle aims to alleviate this problem.</p>

        <p><strong>Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</strong>: A module should be <em>open</em> for extension but <em>closed</em> for modification. That is, modules should be written so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. <sub>-- proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer">Bertrand Meyer</a></sub></p>

    <p>In object-oriented programming, OCP can be achieved in various ways. This often requires separating the <em>specification (i.e. interface)</em> of a module from its <em>implementation</em>.</p>

      <p>📦 In the design given below, the behavior of the <code>CommandQueue</code> class can be altered by adding more concrete <code>Command</code> subclasses. For example, by including a <code>Delete</code> class alongside <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>,
        and <code>Reset</code>, the <code>CommandQueue</code> can now perform delete commands without modifying its code at all. That is, its behavior was extended without having to modify its code. Hence, it was open to extensions, but closed to modification.</p>

      <p>📦 The behavior of a Java generic class can be altered by passing it a different class as a parameter. In the code below, the <code>ArrayList</code> class behaves as a container of <code>Students</code> in one instance and as a container of <code>Admin</code>        objects in the other instance, without having to change its code. That is, the behavior of the <code>ArrayList</code> class is extended without modifying its code.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java">ArrayList students = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> ArrayList&lt; Student &gt;();
ArrayList admins = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> ArrayList&lt; Admin &gt;();  	
</code></pre>
