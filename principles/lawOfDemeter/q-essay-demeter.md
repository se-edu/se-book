Explain the Law of Demeter using code examples. You are to make up your own code examples. Take Minesweeper as the basis for your code examples.

Let us take the `Logic` class as an example.  Assume that it has the following operation.

`setMinefield(Minefield mf): void`

Consider the following that can happen inside this operation:

* `mf.init();`: this does not violate LoD since LoD allows calling operations of parameters received.
* `mf.getCell(1, 3).clear();`: this violates LoD because `Logic` is handling `Cell` objects deep inside `Minefield`. Instead, it should be `mf.clearCellAt(1, 3);`.
* `timer.start();`: this does not violate LoD because `timer` appears to be an internal component (i.e., a variable) of `Logic` itself.
* `Cell c = new Cell();` `c.init();`: this does not violate LoD because `c` was created inside the operation.
