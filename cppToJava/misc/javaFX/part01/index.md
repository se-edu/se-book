# JavaFx 9 Tutorial - Part 1: Scene Builder

## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to create a new JavaFX application in IntelliJ, and to use the SceneBuilder to create a layouts for your application.

<p/>

## Prerequisites

* Latest [Java JDK 9](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html) (includes *JavaFX 9*)
* IntelliJ (2018.2 or later)
* [SceneBuilder 8](http://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) (provided by Gluon as [Oracle no longer ships the tool in binary form](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/sb2download-2177776.html))

<box type="tip">

Do remember the installation path to SceneBuilder 8 as we will need it to configure IntelliJ in a later step.

</box>

## IntelliJ Configurations

If this is the first time using IntelliJ, you need to tell IntelliJ where to find JDK 9 and SceneBuilder.

### Configuring JDK 9

1. On the Welcome screen, press `Configure` → `Project Default` → `Project Structure`.

  <pic src="images/config-jdk-welcome-screen.png" alt="Welcome Screen" height="380" />
  <p/>

  * If you already have a project open, go to the Welcome screen by going to `File` → `Close Project`.

2. Under `Project SDK:`, press `New...` → `JDK`.
3. Select the directory that you install JDK on, and press `OK`.
4. Under `Project language level:`, select `9 - Modules, private methods in interfaces etc.`.

  <pic src="images/config-jdk-project-structure.png" alt="JDK 9 under Project Structure" height="350" />
  <p/>

4. Press `OK` again.

### Configuring Scene Builder

1. On the Welcome screen, press `Configure` → `Settings`.
2. On the left hand side, select `Languages & Frameworks` → `JavaFX`
3. Under `Path to SceneBuilder:`, select the path to where SceneBuilder is installed (e.g. `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\SceneBuilder\SceneBuilder.exe` on Windows)

  <pic src="images/config-scene-builder-settings.png" alt="Scene Builder settings" height="350" />
  <p/>

<box type="info" header="Helpful Links">

The JavaDocs will come in handy when writing your own JavaFX applications:

* [Java 9 API]({{ java_api }})
* [JavaFX 9 API]({{ java_api }}/overview-summary.html)
* [ControlsFX API](http://controlsfx.bitbucket.org/)

Additionally, [Oracle also has a tutorial on JavaFX](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/get_start_apps.htm) if you are interested.

</box>

## Create a new JavaFX Project

1. On the Welcome screen, press `Create New Project`.
  * If you already have a project, you can create a new project by going `File` → `New` → `Project...`.
2. On the left side, select `JavaFX`. Make sure that the Project SDK is set to `9` and `JavaFX Application` is selected.

  <pic src="images/new-project.png" alt="New Project" height="350" />
  <p/>

3. Press `Next`.
4. Give a name for the application (e.g. `AddressApp`), and specify a suitable location.
5. Press `Finish`. If prompted to create a new directory, just press `OK`.

Remove the `sample` package and its content. We will manually create our own package and resources in our tutorial.

We will also have to set up the IDE further, so that warnings and errors show up correctly when working with Java 9:

1. Go to the menu `File` → `Project Structure`.
2. Under `Project language level:`, ensure that `9 - Modules, private methods in interfaces etc.` is selected.

## Create the Packages

In We will create a package for each of the component. Ensure that your Project pane is open (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>). Right click on the `src` folder, and select `New` → `Package`:

* `seedu.address` - contains the _controller_ classes (i.e. the part that deals with the business logic)
* `seedu.address.model` - contains the _model_ classes (i.e. the part that deals with data)
* `seedu.address.view` - contains the _views_ (i.e. the part that deals with presenting the data to the user)

<pic src="images/new-packages.png" alt="New Packages" height="200" />
<p/>

<box type="info">

In subsequent tutorials, our `view` package will also contain some controllers that are directly related to a single view. We will call them `view-controllers`.

</box>

## Create the FXML Layout File

There are two ways to create the UI:

* Use FXML, which is an XML format.
* Programmatically create the interface in Java.

We will use FXML for most parts, so that we can separate the view and controller from each other. Furthermore, we are able to use the Scene Builder tool to edit our FXML file. That means we will not have to directly work with XML.

Right click on the `view` package, and press `New` → `FXML file`. For the file name, type `PersonOverview.fxml`.

## Design with Scene Builder

Right-click on `PersonOverview.fxml` and choose `Open with Scene Builder`. Now you should see the Scene Builder with just an AnchorPane (visible under Hierarchy on the left).

<box type="info">

If IntelliJ prompts for a location of the SceneBuilder executable, make sure to point to where you install SceneBuilder.

</box>

1. Select the `Anchor Pane` in your Hierarchy, and adjust the size under Layout (right side). (Pref Width: 600, Pref Height: 300)

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-main-anchor.png" height="350" />
<p/>

2. Add a `Split Pane (horizontal)` (under `Containers`) by dragging it from the Library into the main area. Right-click the `Split Pane` in the Hierarchy view and select `Fit to Parent`.

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-fit-to-parent.png" height="250" />
<p/>

3. Drag a `TableView` (under `Controls` in Library view) into the left side of the `SplitPane`. Select the `TableView` (not a Column) and set the following layout constraints in the Inspector to the `TableView`. Inside an `AnchorPane` you can always set anchors to the four borders (see [this page](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/layout-tutorial/builtin_layouts.htm) for more information on Layouts).

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-table-anchors.png" height="250" />
<p/>

4. Go to the menu `Preview` → `Show Preview in Window` to see whether the layout configuration is done correctly. Try resizing the window. The `TableView` should resize together with the window as it is anchored to the borders.

5. Change the column text (under Properties) to "First Name" and "Last Name".

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-table-columns.png" height="250" />
<p/>

6. Select the `TableView` and choose `constrainted-resize` for the 'Column Resize Policy'. This ensures that the columns will always fill up the entire available space.

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-table-columns-resize.png" height="200" />
<p/>

7. Add a `Label` on the right side with the text "Person Details:". Adjust the layout using anchors (Top: 5, Left: 5. Right: Blank, Bottom: Blank).

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-title-label.png" width="800" />
<p/>

<box type="tip">

You can use the Search Bar at the top of Library/Inspector to find the respective controls/properties.

</box>

8. Add a `GridPane` on the right side. Select it, and adjust its layout using anchors (Top: 30, Left: 5, Right: 5, Bottom: Blank).

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-grid-pane-1.png" width="600" />
<p/>

9. Add the following labels to the cells, such that the grid is of this form:

| First Name   | Label |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Last Name    | Label |
| Street       | Label |
| City         | Label |
| Postal Code  | Label |
| Birthday     | Label |

<box type="tip">

To add a row to the GridPane, select an existing row number, right click the row number and choose "Add Row Below".

</box>

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-grid-pane-2.png" height="250" />
<p/>

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-grid-pane-3.png" height="280" />
<p/>

10. Add a `ButtonBar` at the bottom. Add three buttons to the bar ("New...", "Edit...","Delete"). Adjust the anchors so that it stays at the bottom right (Top: Blank, Left: Blank, Right: 10, Bottom: 5).

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-button-bar.png" height="50" />
<p/>

11. Now you should see something like the following. Use the `Preview` menu to test its resizing behaviour.

<pic src="images/design-scene-builder-final.png" height="300" />
<p/>

12. Save the `.fxml` file.

## Create the Main Application

The `PersonOverview.fxml` that we just created only contains the content of our entire application. We need another FXML for our root layout, which will contain a menu bar and wraps `PersonOverview.fxml`.

1. Inside IntelliJ, right click on the `view` package, and press `New` → `FXML file`. For the file name, type `RootLayout.fxml`.
2. Right-click on `RootLayout.fxml` and choose `Open with Scene Builder`.
3. Delete the `AnchorPane`. We will use another pane for our root layout.

<pic src="images/create-main-app-delete-anchor-pane.png" height="230" />
<p/>

4. Add `BorderPane` by dragging it from the Library view into the main area.

<pic src="images/create-main-app-add-border-pane.png" height="380" />
<p/>

5. Resize the `BorderPane` (Pref Width: 600, Pref Height: 400)

<pic src="images/create-main-app-resize.png" height="280" />
<p/>

6. Add a `MenuBar` into the `insert TOP` slot. We will not implement menu functionality for now.

<pic src="images/create-main-app-menu-bar.png" height="100" />
<p/>

## The JavaFX Main Class

Now, we need to create the *main Java class* that starts up our application with the `RootLayout.fxml` and adds the `PersonOverview.fxml` in the center.

Right-click on your `seedu.address` package, and choose `New` → `JavaFXApplication`. For the class name, type `MainApp`.

The generated `MainApp.java` class extends from `Application` and contains two methods. This is the basic structure that we need to start a JavaFX Application. The most important part for us is the `start(Stage primaryStage)` method. It is automatically called when the application is `launch()` from within the `main()` method.

As you see, the `start(...)` method receives a `Stage` as parameter. The following graphic illustrates the structure of every JavaFX application:

<pic src="images/javafx-hierarchy.png" height="350" />
<p/>

*It's like a theater play:* The `Stage` is the main container which is usually a `Window` with a border and the typical minimize, maximize and close buttons. Inside the `Stage` you add a `Scene` which can, of course, be switched out by another `Scene`. Inside the `Scene` the actual JavaFX nodes like `AnchorPane`, `TextBox`, etc. are added.

See [this page](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/scene-graph-tutorial/scenegraph.htm) for more info on working with the JavaFX Scene Graph.

Open `MainApp.java` and replace the code with the following:

**MainApp.java**
```java
package seedu.address;

import java.io.IOException;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.layout.AnchorPane;
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class MainApp extends Application {
    private Stage primaryStage;
    private BorderPane rootLayout;

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        this.primaryStage = primaryStage;
        this.primaryStage.setTitle("AddressApp");

        initRootLayout();

        showPersonOverview();
    }

    /**
     * Initializes the root layout.
     */
    public void initRootLayout() {
        try {
            // Load root layout from fxml file.
            FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader();
            loader.setLocation(MainApp.class.getResource("view/RootLayout.fxml"));
            rootLayout = loader.load();

            // Show the scene containing the root layout.
            Scene scene = new Scene(rootLayout);
            primaryStage.setScene(scene);
            primaryStage.show();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    /**
     * Shows the person overview inside the root layout.
     */
    public void showPersonOverview() {
        try {
            // Load person overview.
            FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader();
            loader.setLocation(MainApp.class.getResource("view/PersonOverview.fxml"));
            AnchorPane personOverview = loader.load();

            // Set person overview into the center of root layout.
            rootLayout.setCenter(personOverview);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    /**
     * Returns the main stage.
     */
    public Stage getPrimaryStage() {
        return primaryStage;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

The various comments should give you some hints about what's going on.

## Importing JavaFx 9

JavaFx 9 is a separate module from Java 9. We must ensure that the modules are imported correctly.

Notice that IntellJ will complain about the imported modules "not being in the module graph":

<pic src="images/javafx-import-error.png" height="100" />
<p/>

To fix this:

1. Ensure that your Project pane is open (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>). Right click on the `src` folder, and select `New` → `module-info.java`:
2. Add the following `requires` and `exports` in order to import and export the modules correctly:

```java
module AddressApp {
    requires javafx.graphics;
    requires javafx.fxml;
    requires javafx.controls;

    exports seedu.address;
}
```

## Running the Application

If you run the application now (right click `MainApp.java` and select `Run MainApp.main()`), you should see something like this:

<pic src="images/address-app-final-screenshot.png" height="350" />
<p/>

## Possible Issues

If JavaFx fails to load `PersonOverview.fxml`, you might get the following error message:

```
javafx.fxml.LoadException:
/.../AddressApp/out/production/AddressApp/seedu/address/view/PersonOverview.fxml:15
```

To solve this issue, open `PersonOverview.fxml` normally in IntelliJ and ensure that there is no such attribute around:

`fx:controller="seedu.address.view.PersonOverview"`
