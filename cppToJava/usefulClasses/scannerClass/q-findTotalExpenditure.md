<panel type="dark" header="###  <small><small>{{ icon_important }} [Key Exercise] find total expenditure</small></small>" expanded >

Write a program to ask the user for a description of overseas expenses (presumably, the user has just returned from an overseas trip) and calculate the total in local currency.
* The conversion rate from overseas currency to local currency : overseas `$1.0` = local `$1.70`
* The user can describe expenses is in free form text, as one line. The program takes all amounts mentioned in the format `$amount` e.g., `$1.50`


Here is one example output: {{ icon_output }}
```{.no-line-numbers}
Your expenses while overseas?beer $4.50 books $3.00 $5.00 for food, that's all
Expenses in overseas currency:[$4.50, $3.00, $5.00]
Total in local currency: $21.25
```
Here is another: {{ icon_output }}
```{.no-line-numbers}
Your expenses while overseas?nothing. I lived off my friends all the time.
Expenses in overseas currency:[]
Total in local currency: $0.00
```
One more: {{ icon_output }}
```{.no-line-numbers}
Your expenses while overseas? Just $10
Expenses in overseas currency:[$10]
Total in local currency: $17.00
```

Here's the skeleton code to use as the starting point:

```java
public class Main {

    // You can add more methods here

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String line;
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Your expenses while overseas?");
       // TODO: add your code here
    }
}
```

{{ icon_tip }} You can use the `split` method of the `String` class to convert a sentence into an array of words. e.g.,<br>
```java{highlight-lines="3-4"}
String sentence = "hello my dear";

// split using the space as the delimiter
String[] words = sentence.split(" ");

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words));
```
{{ icon_output_right }} `[hello, my, dear]`

<panel type="seamless" header="Hint">

{{ icon_tip }} You can use `String.format("%.2f", doubleValue)` to format `doubleValue` to two decimal points.<br>
e.g., `String.format("%.2f", 1.3334)` {{ icon_output_right }} `1.33`

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static String[] filterAmounts(String sentence) {
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
        String[] result = new String[words.length];
        int wordCount = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (word.startsWith("$")) {
                result[wordCount] = word;
                wordCount++;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOf(result, wordCount);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String line;
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Your expenses while overseas?");
        line = in.nextLine();

        String[] amounts = filterAmounts(line);
        System.out.println("Expenses in overseas currency:" + Arrays.toString(amounts));
        double total = 0;
        for (String amount : amounts) {
            // convert amount to double, multiply by currency conversion rate, and add to total
        }
        System.out.println("Total in local currency: $" + String.format("%.2f", total));

    }
}
