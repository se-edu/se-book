{{ icon_info }} Fun fact: The language was initially called _Oak_ after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name _Green_ and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee. <small>--[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))</small>

**Oracle became the owner of Java in 2010**, when it acquired Sun Microsystems.

Java has remained the **most popular language in the world** for several years now (as at July 2018), according to the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
