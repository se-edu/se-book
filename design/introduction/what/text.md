**Software design has two main aspects:**
* **Product/external design: designing the external behavior of the product to meet the users' requirements.** This is usually done by product designers with input from business analysts, user experience experts, user representatives, etc.
* **Implementation/internal design: designing how the product will be implemented to meet the required external behavior.** This is usually done by software architects and software engineers.
