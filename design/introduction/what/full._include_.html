      <p>Design in the creative process of transforming the problem into a solution; the solution is also called design. <sub>-- 📖 <em>Software Engineering Theory and Practice</em>,  Shari Lawrence; Atlee, Joanne M. Pfleeger</sub></p>

    <p><strong>Software design has two main aspects:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Product/external design: designing the external behavior of the product to meet the users' requirements.</strong> This is usually done by product designers with the input from business analysts, user experience experts, user representatives,
        etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Implementation/internal design: designing how the product will be implemented to meet the required external behavior.</strong> This is usually done by software architects and software engineers.</li>
    </ul>
