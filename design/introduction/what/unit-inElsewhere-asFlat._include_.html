      <p><strong>Software design has two main aspects:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Product/external design: designing the external behavior of the product to meet the users' requirements.</strong> This is usually done by product designers with the input from business analysts, user experience experts, user representatives,
          etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation/internal design: designing how the product will be implemented to meet the required external behavior.</strong> This is usually done by software architects and software engineers.</li>
      </ul>
