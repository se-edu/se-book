<p>Design is the creative process of transforming the problem into a solution; the solution is also called design. <sub>-- ðŸ“– <em>Software Engineering Theory and Practice</em>,  Shari Lawrence; Atlee, Joanne M. Pfleeger</sub></p></box>
<p><strong>Software design has two main aspects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product/external design: designing the external behavior of the product to meet the users' requirements.</strong> This is usually done by product designers with input from business analysts, user experience experts, user representatives, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation/internal design: designing how the product will be implemented to meet the required external behavior.</strong> This is usually done by software architects and software engineers.</li></ul></div>
