        <p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.</strong></p>
        <p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
          <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
          <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
          <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of popular IDEs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Java: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans</li>
          <li>C#, C++: Visual Studio</li>
          <li>Swift: XCode</li>
          <li>Python: PyCharm</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some Web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>
        <p>Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>👎 <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
              This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
              <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
              <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>👎 <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to these reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
              <li>If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>👍 <strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</p>
