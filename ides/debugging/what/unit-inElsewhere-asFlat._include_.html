<p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red"><span><strong><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span> Bad</strong></span></span> -- <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>. This approach is not recommended due to these reasons:
<ul>
<li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
<li>These extraneous program modifications increase the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
<li>These print statements, if not removed promptly after the debugging, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li></ul></li>
<li><span style="color: red"><span><strong><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span> Bad</strong></span></span> -- <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to these reasons:
<ul>
<li>It is a difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
<li>If you didn't spot the error while writing the code, you might not spot the error when reading the code either.</li></ul></li>
<li><span style="color: green"><span><strong><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span> Good</strong></span></span> -- <strong>Using a debugger</strong>:  A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through the code one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</li></ul></div>
