**Professional software engineers often write code using _Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)_. IDEs support most development-related work within the same tool** (hence, the term _integrated_).

An IDE generally consists of:

* A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.
* A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.
* A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.
* Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g., support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, modeling support, AI-assisted coding help, collaborative coding with others.

Examples of popular IDEs:
* Java: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans
* C#, C++: Visual Studio
* Swift: XCode
* Python: PyCharm
* Multiple languages: VS Code

Some web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's [Cloud9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/).

Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g., [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)) over heavier IDEs.
