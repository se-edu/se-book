<p>Anything that is already clear in the code need not be described in words. Instead, <strong>focus on providing higher level information that is not readily visible in the code or comments</strong>.</p>
<p>Refrain from duplicating chunks of text. When describing several similar algorithms/designs/APIs, etc., do not simply duplicate large chunks of text. Instead, <strong>describe the similarities in one place and emphasize only the differences in other places.</strong> It is very annoying to see pages and pages of similar text without any indication as to how they differ from each other.</p></div>
