<p>The main advantage of the top-down approach is that the document is structured like an upside down tree (root at the top) and <strong>the reader can travel down a path she is interested in until she reaches the component she is interested to learn in-depth</strong>, without having to read the entire document or understand the whole system.</p></div>
