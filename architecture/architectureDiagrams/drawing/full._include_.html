    <p>While architecture diagrams have no standard notation, try to follow these basic guidelines when drawing them.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Minimize the variety of symbols. If the symbols you choose do not have widely-understood meanings <span class="dimmed"> e.g. A drum symbol is widely-understood as representing a database</span>, explain their meaning.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Avoid the indiscriminate use of double-headed arrows to show interactions between components.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦Consider the two architecture diagrams of the same software given below. Because <code>Diagram 2</code> uses double headed arrows, the important fact that GUI has a bi-directional dependency with the Logic component is no longer captured.</p>
