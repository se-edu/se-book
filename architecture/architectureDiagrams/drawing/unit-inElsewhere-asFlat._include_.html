<p>While architecture diagrams have no standard notation, try to follow these basic guidelines when drawing them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Minimize the variety of symbols. If the symbols you choose do not have widely-understood meanings <span class="dimmed">e.g., A drum symbol is widely-understood as representing a database</span>, explain their meaning.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Avoid the indiscriminate use of double-headed arrows to show interactions between components.</p></li></ul>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Consider the two architecture diagrams of the same software given below. Because <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Diagram 2</code> uses double-headed arrows, the important fact that GUI has a bidirectional dependency with the Logic component is no longer captured.</p>
