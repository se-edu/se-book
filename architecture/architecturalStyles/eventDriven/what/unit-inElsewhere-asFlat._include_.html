      <p><strong><em>Event-driven</em> style controls the flow of the application by detecting <span data-mb-component-type="tooltip" v-b-tooltip.hover.top.html="tooltipInnerContentGetter" class="trigger"><span data-mb-slot-name="_content">An event is a notable occurrence that happens inside or outside the software, such as the user clicking a button, a timer running out, minimizing a window, etc.</span>events</span> from event <em>emitters</em> and communicating those events to interested event <em>consumers</em> .</strong> This architectural style is often used in GUIs.</p>

        <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> When the ‘button clicked’ event occurs in a GUI, that event can be transmitted to components that are interested in reacting to that event. Similarly, events detected at a Printer port can be transmitted to components related to operating the Printer. The same event can be sent to multiple consumers too.</p>
