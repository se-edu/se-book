        <p>The software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them. Architecture is concerned
          with the public side of interfaces; private details of elements—details having to do solely with internal implementation—are not architectural.

      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>The software architecture shows the overall organization of the system and can be viewed as a very high-level design.</strong> It usually consists of a set of interacting components that fit together to achieve the required functionality.
        It should be a simple and technically viable structure that is well-understood and agreed-upon by everyone in the development team, and it forms the basis for the implementation.</p>
