    <p><strong>Multi-level design can be done in a top-down manner, bottom-up manner, or as a mix.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Top-down: Design the high-level design first and flesh out the lower levels later. This is especially useful when designing big and novel systems where the high-level design needs to be stable before lower levels can be designed.</li>
      <li>Bottom-up: Design lower level components first and put them together to create the higher-level systems later. This is not usually scalable for bigger systems. One instance where this approach might work is when designing a variations of an existing
        system or re-purposing existing components to build a new system.</li>
      <li>Mix: Design the top levels using the top-down approach but switch to a bottom-up approach when designing the bottom levels.</li>

              <p>Top-down design is better than bottom-up design.</p>

                <li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="81698" type="radio"> True</label></li>

              <div slot="answer">
                <p>False</p>
                <p>Explanation: Not necessarily. It depends on the situation. Bottom-up design may be preferable when there are lot of existing components we want to reuse.</p>
