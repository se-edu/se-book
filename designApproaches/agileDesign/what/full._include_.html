    <p><strong><em>Agile design</em> can be contrasted with <em>full upfront design</em> in the following way</strong>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Agile designs are emergent, they’re not defined up front.</strong> Your overall system design will emerge over time, evolving to fulfill new requirements and take advantage of new technologies as appropriate. Although you will often do <strong>some initial architectural modeling at the very beginning</strong>        of a project, this will be just enough to get your team going. This approach does not produce a fully documented set of models in place before you may begin coding. <sub>-- adapted from <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDesign.htm">agilemodeling.com</a></sub></p>

                <p>Explanation: Yes, that is why they do not believe in spending too much time creating a detailed and full design at the very beginning. However, the architecture is expected to remain relatively stable even in the agile design approach.</p>
