You can use the `git status` command to check the status of the working directory.

```{.no-line-numbers}
$ git status
```
{{ icon_output }}
```{.no-line-numbers}
# On branch master
#
# No commits yet
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   a.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
