GitHub allows you to **create a remote copy of another remote repo, called _forking_**.
{% endcall %}

**A {{ show_git_term("fork") }} is a copy of a remote repository** created on the same hosting service such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. On GitHub, you can fork a repository from another user or organisation into your own space (i.e., your user account or an organisation you have sufficient access to). {{ show_git_term("Forking") }} is particularly useful if you want to experiment with a repo but donâ€™t have write permissions to the original -- you can fork it and work on your own remote copy without affecting the original repository.

<!-- ================== start: HANDS-ON =========================== -->
{% call show_hands_on_practical("Forking a repo on GitHub")  %}

{{ hp_number(hop_preparation) }} **Create a GitHub account if you don't have one yet.**

{{ hp_number('1') }}  **Go to the GitHub repo you want to fork** e.g., [samplerepo-things](https://github.com/se-edu/samplerepo-things)

{{ hp_number('2') }} **Click on the <pic eager src="images/fork.png" height="30" /> button** in the top-right corner. In the next step,
  * choose to fork to your own account or to another GitHub organization that you are an admin of.
  * ==un-tick the <code>[ ] Copy the master branch only</code> option==, so that you get copies of other branches (if any) in the repo.

**Forking is not a Git feature**, but a feature provided by hosted Git services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

<box type="info" seamless>

GitHub does not allow you to fork the same repo more than once to the same destination. If you want to re-fork, you need to delete the previous fork.
