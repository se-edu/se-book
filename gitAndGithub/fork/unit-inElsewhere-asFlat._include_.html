<p>Given below is a scenario you can try in order to learn how to <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:githubForking-rcsForking">fork</trigger> a repo:.</p>

<p><strong>A <mark><em>fork</em></mark> is a remote copy of a remote repo</strong>. As you know, cloning creates a local copy of a repo. In contrast, forking creates a remote copy of a Git repo hosted on GitHub. This is particularly useful if you want to play around with a GitHub repo but you don't have write permissions to it; you can simply fork the repo and do whatever you want with the fork as you are the owner of the fork.</p></div></modal>
<p><strong>0. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one yet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Go to the GitHub repo you want to fork</strong> e.g., <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/samplerepo-things">samplerepo-things</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Click on the <pic src="/se-book/gitAndGithub/fork/images/fork.png" height="30"></pic> button</strong> on the top-right corner. In the next step,</p>
<ul>
<li>choose to fork to your own account or to another GitHub organization that you are an admin of.</li>
<li><mark>Un-tick the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>[ ] Copy the master branch only</code> option</mark>, so that you get copies of other branches (if any) in the repo.</li></ul>
<box type="important" seamless>
<p>As you might have guessed from the above, <strong>forking is not a Git feature</strong>, but a feature provided by remote Git hosting services such as Github.</p></box>
<box type="info" seamless>
<p>GitHub does not allow you to fork the same repo more than once to the same destination. If you want to re-fork, you need to delete the previous fork.</p></box></div>
