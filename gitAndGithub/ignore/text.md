Git allows you to **specify which files should be omitted from version control**.
{% endcall %}

Often, there are files inside the Git working folder that you don't want to revision-control e.g., temporary log files. Follow the steps below to learn how to configure Git to ignore such files.

**1. Add a file into your repo's working folder that you supposedly don't want to revision-control** e.g., a file named `temp.txt`. Observe how Git has detected the new file.

**2. Configure Git to ignore that file:**

{{ show_git_tabs() }}

**The `.gitignore` file**

The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files to ignore when tracking revision history. That file itself can be either revision controlled or ignored.
* To version control it (the more common choice â€“ which allows you to track how the `.gitignore` file changes over time), simply commit it as you would commit any other file.
* To ignore it, follow the same steps you followed above when you set Git to ignore the `temp.txt` file.

* It supports file patterns e.g., adding `temp/*.tmp` to the `.gitignore` file prevents Git from tracking any `.tmp` files in the `temp` directory.

**Files recommended to be omitted from version control**

* **Binary files** _generated_ when building your project %%e.g., `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.exe`%% (reasons: 1. no need to version control these files as they can be generated again from the source code 2. Revision control systems are optimized for tracking text-based files, not binary files.
* **Temporary files** %%e.g., log files generated while testing the product%%
* **Local files** i.e., files specific to your own computer %%e.g., local settings of your IDE%%
* **Sensitive content** i.e., files containing sensitive/personal information %%e.g., credential files, personal identification data%% (especially, if there is a possibility of those files getting leaked via the revision control system).
