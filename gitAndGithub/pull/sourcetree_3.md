   * `Remote name`: the name you want to assign to the remote repo e.g., `upstream1`
   * `URL/path`: the URL of your repo (ending in `.git`) that. Suggested: `https://github.com/se-edu/samplerepo-things-2.git` ([`samplerepo-things-2`](https://github.com/se-edu/samplerepo-things-2) is another repo that has a shared history with `samplerepo-things`)
   * `Username`: your GitHub username<br><br>

1. Now, you can fetch or pull (pulling will fetch the branch _and_ merge the new code to the current branch) from the added repo as you did before ==but choose the remote name of the repo you want to pull from== (instead of `origin`):<br>
   Click the `Fetch` button or the `Pull` button first.<br>
