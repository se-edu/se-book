To push the newer commit(s) to the remote, any of the following commands should work:

* `git push origin master`
* `git push origin`<br>
  (due to tracking you set up earlier, Git will assume you are pushing the`master` branch)
* `git push`<br>
  (due to tracking, Git will assume you are pushing to the remote `origin` and to the branch `master` i.e., `origin/master`)
