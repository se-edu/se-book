**To create another PR** while the current PR is still under review, you can create a new branch, add your new proposed change in that branch, and create a new PR using that branch instead of the `master` branch.

Steps for creating a PR from another branch is similar to how you created one from the `master` branch, except when sending the PR you should choose the other branch in place of the `master` branch.
