            <p><strong>Merge conflicting PRs one at a time.</strong> Before merging a PR, you’ll have to resolve conflicts. Steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>[Optional] A member can inform the PR author (by posting a comment) that there is a conflict in the PR.</li>
              <li>PR author: Pull the <code>master</code> branch from the repo in your team org. Merge the pulled <code>master</code> branch to your PR branch. Resolve the merge conflict that crops up during the merge. Push the updated PR branch to your fork.</li>
              <li>Another member or the PR author: When GitHub does not indicate a conflict anymore, you can go ahead and merge the PR.</li>
