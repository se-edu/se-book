          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fork that repo</strong> from your team org to your own GitHub account.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a PR</strong> to add a file <code>yourName.md</code> <span class="dimmed"> (e.g. <code>jonhDoe.md</code>) </span> containing a brief resume of yourself <span class="dimmed"> (branch → commit → push → create PR)</span></li>

          <ul>
            <li>A team member (not the PR author): Review the PR by adding comments (can be just dummy comments).</li>
            <li>PR author: Update the PR by pushing more commits to it, to simulate updating the PR based on review comments.</li>
            <li>Another team member: Merge the PR using the GitHub interface.</li>
            <li>All members: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/">Sync your local repo (and your fork) with upstream repo</a>. In this case, your <em>upstream repo</em> is the repo in your team org.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Each team member: Create a PR to add yourself under the <code>Team Members</code> section in the <code>README.md</code>.</li>
            <li>One member: in the <code>master</code> branch, remove John Doe and Jane Doe from the <code>README.md</code>, commit, and push to the main repo.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Merge conflicting PRs one at a time.</strong> Before merging a PR, you’ll have to resolve conflicts. Steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>[Optional] A member can inform the PR author (by posting a comment) that there is a conflict in the PR.</li>
            <li>PR author: Pull the <code>master</code> branch from the repo in your team org. Merge the pulled <code>master</code> branch to your PR branch. Resolve the merge conflict that crops up during the merge. Push the updated PR branch to your fork.</li>
            <li>Another member or the PR author: When GitHub does not indicate a conflict anymore, you can go ahead and merge the PR.</li>
          </ul>
