Before you start learning Git, **you need to install some tools** in your computer.
{% endcall %}

First, install Git.

Next, ensure you have a suitable terminal app. Our instructions assume you use a Bash terminal.

Optionally, install a Git client.
e.g., Sourcetree ([installation instructions](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html)), which is Git + a GUI for Git.

If you are new to Git, **we recommend you learn !!both!! the GUI method and the CLI method** -- The GUI method will help you visualize the result better while the CLI method is more universal (i.e., you will not be tied to any GUI) and more flexible/powerful.

**It is fine to learn the CLI way only** (using a GUI is optional), especially if you normally prefer to work with CLI over GUI.
