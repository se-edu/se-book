<div id="overview">

Before you start learning Git, there are some tools that you need to install in your computer.
</div>

Have a suitable terminal app.

Install Git.

Optionally, install a Git client.
e.g., Sourcetree ([installation instructions](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html)), which is Git + a GUI for Git.

<box type="tip" seamless>

If you are new to Git, **we recommend you learn !!both!! the GUI method and the CLI method** -- The GUI method will help you visualize the result better while the CLI method is more universal (i.e., you will not be tied to any GUI) and more flexible/powerful.

**It is fine to learn the CLI way only** (using Sourcetree is optional), especially if you normally prefer to work with CLI over GUI.
