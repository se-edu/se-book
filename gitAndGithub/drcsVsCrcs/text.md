**RCS can be done in two ways: the _centralized_ way and the _distributed_ way.**

**Centralized RCS (CRCS for short) uses a central remote repo that is shared by the team.** Team members interact directly with this central repository. Older RCS tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model.

**Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS) allows multiple remote/local repos** working together. The workflow can vary from team to team.  For example, every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in the diagram below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support the distributed approach.
