Click the `History` to see the revision graph.

* In some versions of Sourcetree, the `HEAD` ref may not be shown -- it is implied that the `HEAD` ref is pointing to the same commit the currently active branch ref is pointing.
* If the remote-tracking branch ref (e.g., `origin/master`) is not showing up, you may need to enable the `Show Remote Branches` option.
