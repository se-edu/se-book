**A _software requirement_ specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.**

**A software project may be,**
* **a _brown-field_ project** i.e., develop a product to replace/update an existing software product
* **a _green-field_ project** i.e., develop a totally new system with no precedent

In either case, requirements need to be gathered, analyzed, specified, and managed.

**Requirements come from _stakeholders_.**

**Identifying requirements is often not easy.** For example, stakeholders may not be aware of their precise needs, may not know how to communicate their requirements correctly, may not be willing to spend effort in identifying requirements, etc.
