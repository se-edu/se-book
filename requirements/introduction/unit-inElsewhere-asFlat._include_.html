<p><strong>A <em>software requirement</em> specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A software project may be,</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a <em>brownfield</em> project</strong> i.e., develop a product to replace/update an existing software product</li>
<li><strong>a <em>greenfield</em> project</strong> i.e., develop a totally new system from scratch</li></ul>
<p>In either case, requirements need to be gathered, analyzed, specified, and managed.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements come from <em>stakeholders</em>.</strong></p>
<box type="definition" seamless>
<div><p><strong>Stakeholder</strong>: An individual or an organization that is involved or potentially affected by the software project. e.g. users, sponsors, developers, interest groups, government agencies, etc.</p></div></box>
<p><strong>Identifying requirements is often not easy.</strong> For example, stakeholders may not be aware of their precise needs, may not know how to communicate their requirements correctly, may not be willing to spend effort in identifying requirements, etc.</p>

<li><strong>Users</strong> e.g., students, instructors, admins</li>

<li><strong>Vendors</strong> (their employees, their investors) involved in selling the LMS product/services to education institutions</li></ul>
<p>Some examples of non-obvious stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developers</strong> and others involved in the software project e.g., project managers, testers, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem community</strong> e.g., third-party app developers, trainers</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory bodies</strong> e.g., those who are overseeing the storage and use of data of their citizens</li>
<li><strong>Special interest groups</strong> e.g., organizations who are concerned about rights of minors</li>
<li>...</li></ul></panel></panel></div></div></div></div></div></div>
