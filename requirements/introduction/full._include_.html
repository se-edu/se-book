    <p><strong>A <em>software requirement</em> specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.</strong></p>
    <p>A software project may be,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a <em>brown-field</em> project i.e., develop a product to replace/update an existing software product</li>
      <li>a <em>green-field</em> project i.e., develop a totally new system with no precedent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In either case, requirements need to be gathered, analyzed, specified, and managed.</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements come from <em>stakeholders</em>.</strong></p>
    <tip-box type="info">
      <div>
        <p><strong>Stakeholder</strong>: A party that is potentially affected by the software project. e.g. users, sponsors, developers, interest groups, government agencies, etc.</p>
      </div>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Identifying requirements is often not easy. For example, stakeholders may not be aware of their precise needs, may not know how to communicate their requirements correctly, may not be willing to spend effort in identifying requirements, etc.</p>
