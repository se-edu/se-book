<div id="body">

A bidirectional association in the design (shown in (a)) is usually emulated at code level using two variables (as shown in (b)).

```java
class Man {
    Woman girlfriend;

    void setGirlfriend(Woman w) {
        girlfriend = w;
    }
    // ...
}
```

```java
class Woman {
    Man boyfriend;

    void setBoyfriend(Man m) {
        boyfriend = m;
    }
}
```

The two classes are meant to be used as follows:

```java
Woman jean;
Man james;
// ...
james.setGirlfriend(jean);
jean.setBoyfriend(james);
```
Suppose the two classes were used like this instead:

```java
Woman jean;
Man james, yong;
// ...
james.setGirlfriend(jean);
jean.setBoyfriend(yong);
```

Now James' girlfriend is Jean, while Jean's boyfriend is not James. This situation is a result of the code not being defensive enough to stop this "love triangle". In such a situation, you could say that _the referential integrity has been violated_. This means that _there is an inconsistency in object references_.

<p/>

One way to prevent this situation is to implement the two classes as shown below. Note how the referential integrity is maintained.

```java
public class Woman {
    private Man boyfriend;

    public void setBoyfriend(Man m) {
        if (boyfriend == m) {
            return;
        }
        if (boyfriend != null) {
            boyfriend.breakUp();
        }
        boyfriend = m;
        m.setGirlfriend(this);
    }

    public void breakUp() {
        boyfriend = null;
    }
    // ...
}
```

```java
public class Man {
    private Woman girlfriend;

    public void setGirlfriend(Woman w) {
        if (girlfriend == w) {
            return;
        }
        if (girlfriend != null) {
            girlfriend.breakUp();
        }
        girlfriend = w;
        w.setBoyfriend(this);
    }
    public void breakUp() {
        girlfriend = null;
    }
    // ...
}
```

When `james.setGirlfriend(jean)` is executed, the code ensures that `james` breaks up with any current girlfriend before he accepts `jean` as his girlfriend. Furthermore, the code ensures that `jean` breaks up with any existing boyfriends before accepting `james` as her boyfriend.
