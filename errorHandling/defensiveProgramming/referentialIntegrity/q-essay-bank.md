<question has-input="true">

Implement this bidirectional association.  Note that the `Bank` uses the `accNumber` attribute to uniquely identify an `Account` object. Assume the `Bank` class is responsible for maintaining the links between objects.

The code below contains a method in the `Bank` class to create an account; the bank field in the new account is thereby filled by the bank creating it.

Assume that once an `Account` has been assigned to a `Bank`, it cannot be assigned to a different `Bank`. Once the `Account` is removed from the `Bank`, it will not be used anymore (hence, no need to remove the link from `Account` to `Bank`).

```java
public class Account {
    private int accNumber;
    private Bank theBank;

    public Account(int n, Bank b) {
        accNumber = n;
        theBank = b;
    }
    public int getNumber() {
        return accNumber;
    }
    public Bank getBank() {
        return theBank;
    }
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Bank {
    private HashMap<Integer, Account> theAccounts = new HashMap<Integer, Account>();

    public void createAccount(int n) {
        addAccount(new Account(n, this));
    }
    public void addAccount(Account a) {
        theAccounts.put(a.getNumber(), a);
    }
    public void removeAccount(int accNumber) {
        theAccounts.remove(accNumber);
    }
    public Account lookupAccount(int accNumber) {
        return theAccounts.get(accNumber);
    }
}
```
