<div id="body">

Consider the association given below. A defensive implementation requires us to ensure that a `MinedCell` cannot exist without a `Mine` and vice versa which requires simultaneous object creation. However, Java can only create one object at a time. Given below are two alternative implementations, both of which violate the multiplicity for a short period of time.

Option 1:
```java
class MinedCell {
    private Mine mine;

    public MinedCell(Mine m) {
        if (m == null) {
            showError();
        }
        mine = m;
    }
    // ...
}
```

Option 1 forces us to keep a `Mine` without a `MinedCell` (until the `MinedCell` is created).

Option 2:
```java
class MinedCell {
    private Mine mine;

    public MinedCell() {
        mine = new Mine();
    }
    // ...
}
```

Option 2 is more defensive because the `Mine` is immediately linked to a `MinedCell`.
