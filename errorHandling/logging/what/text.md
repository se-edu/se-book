**_Logging_ is the deliberate recording of certain information during a program execution for future reference.** Logs are typically written to a log file but it is also possible to log information in other ways %%e.g. into a database or a remote server%%.

**_Logging_ can be useful for troubleshooting problems**. A good logging system records some system information regularly. When bad things happen to a system %%e.g. an unanticipated failure%%, their associated log files may provide indications of what went wrong and actions can then be taken to prevent it from happening again.

{{ icon_tip }} **A log file is like the <tooltip content="flight data recorder">black box</tooltip> of an airplane**; they don't prevent problems but they can be helpful in understanding what went wrong after the fact.
