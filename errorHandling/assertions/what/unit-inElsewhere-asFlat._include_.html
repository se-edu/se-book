      <p><strong><em>Assertions</em> are used to define assumptions about the program state so that the runtime can verify them.</strong> An assertion failure indicates a possible bug in the code <span class="dimmed">because the code has resulted in a program state that violates an assumption about how the code <em>should</em> behave</span>.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> An assertion can be used to express something like <em>when the execution comes to this point, the variable <code>v</code> cannot be null</em>.</p>
      </tip-box>
      <p><strong>If the runtime detects an <em>assertion failure</em>, it typically take some drastic action</strong> such as terminating the execution with an error message. This is because an assertion failure indicates a possible bug and the sooner the
        execution stops, the safer it is.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> In the Java code below, suppose we set an assertion that <code>timeout</code> returned by <code>Config.getTimeout()</code> is greater than <code>0</code>. Now, if the <code>Config.getTimeout()</code> returned
          <code>-1</code> in a specific execution of this line, the runtime can detect it as a <em>assertion failure</em> -- i.e. an assumption about the expected behavior of the code turned out to be wrong which could potentially be the result of a bug
          -- and take some drastic action such as terminating the execution.</p>
