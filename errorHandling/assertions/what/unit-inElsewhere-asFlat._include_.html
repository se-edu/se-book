<p><strong><em>Assertions</em> are used to define assumptions about the program state so that the runtime can verify them.</strong> An assertion failure indicates a possible bug in the code <span class="dimmed">because the code has resulted in a program state that violates an assumption about how the code <em>should</em> behave</span>.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> An assertion can be used to express something like <em>when the execution comes to this point, the variable <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>v</code> cannot be null</em>.</p></box>
<p><strong>If the runtime detects an <em>assertion failure</em>, it typically takes some drastic action</strong> such as terminating the execution with an error message. This is because an assertion failure indicates a possible bug and the sooner the execution stops, the safer it is.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> In the Java code below, suppose you set an assertion that <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>timeout</code> returned by <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Config.getTimeout()</code> is greater than <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>0</code>. Now, if <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Config.getTimeout()</code> returns <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>-1</code> in a specific execution of this line, the runtime can detect it as an <em>assertion failure</em> -- i.e. an assumption about the expected behavior of the code turned out to be wrong which could potentially be the result of a bug -- and take some drastic action such as terminating the execution.</p>
