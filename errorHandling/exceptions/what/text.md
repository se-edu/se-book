Exceptions are used to deal with ‘unusual’ but not entirely unexpected situations that the program might encounter at run time.

<tip-box type="primary">

<include src="../../../common/definitions.md#def-exception" />

</tip-box>

Examples:

*	A network connection encounters a timeout due to a slow server.
*	The code tries to read a file from the hard disk but the file is corrupted and cannot be read.

</tip-box>

Exceptions are not program bugs. Rather, they are unusual situations that need to be recovered from, if possible.
