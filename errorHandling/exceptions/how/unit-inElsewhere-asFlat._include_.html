      <p><strong>Most languages allow a method/function to encapsulate the unusual situation in an Exception object and 'throw'/'raise' that object so that another piece of code can 'catch' it and deal with it.</strong> This is especially useful when code
        segment that encountered the unusual situation does not know how to deal with it.</p>
      <p><strong>Exception objects can propagate up the function call hierarchy until it is dealt with.</strong> Usually, an exception thrown by a function is caught by the caller function. If the called function does not know how to deal with the exception
        it caught, it can throw/raise the Exception object to its own caller. If none of the callers is prepared to deal with the exception, the exceptions can propagate through the
        <tooltip content="the hieararchy of function calls">function call stack</tooltip> until it is received by the main function and thrown to the runtime, thus halting the system.</p>
      <p>Advantages of exception handling in this way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability to propagate error information through the call stack.</li>
        <li>The separation of code that deals with 'unusual' situations from the code that does the 'usual' work.</li>
      </ul>

                  <p>Explanation: Exceptions cannot <em>prevent</em> problems in the environment. They can only be used to handle and recover from such problems.</p>
