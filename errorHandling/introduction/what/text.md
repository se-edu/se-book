> Well-written applications include error-handling code that allows them to recover gracefully from unexpected errors. When an error occurs, the application may need to request user intervention, or it may be able to recover on its own. In extreme cases, the application may log the user off or shut down the system. -- <sub>[Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-my/windows/win32/debug/error-handling)</sub>
