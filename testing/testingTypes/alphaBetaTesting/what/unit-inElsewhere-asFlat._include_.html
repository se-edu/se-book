<p><strong><em>Alpha testing</em> is performed by the users, under controlled conditions set by the software development team.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Beta testing</em> is performed by a selected subset of target users of the system in their natural work setting.</strong></p>
<p>An <em>open beta release</em> is the release of not-yet-production-quality-but-almost-there software to the general population.  For example, Google’s Gmail was in 'beta' for many years before the label was finally removed.</p></div>
