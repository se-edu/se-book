<p><strong><em>Acceptance testing</em> (aka <em>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</em>: test the system to ensure it meets the user requirements.</strong></p></div></box>
<p>Acceptance tests give an assurance to the customer that the system does what it is intended to do. Acceptance test cases are often defined at the beginning of the project, usually based on the use case specification. Successful completion of UAT is often a prerequisite to the project sign-off.</p></div>
