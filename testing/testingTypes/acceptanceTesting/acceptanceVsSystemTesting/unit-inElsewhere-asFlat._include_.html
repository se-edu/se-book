      <p>Acceptance testing comes after system testing. Similar to system testing, acceptance testing involves testing the whole system.</p>
      <p>Some differences between system testing and acceptance testing:</p>

        <p><strong>Requirement Specification vs System Specification</strong></p>
        <p>The requirement specification need not be the same as the system specification. Some example differences:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th style="text-align:left">Requirements Specification</th>
                <th style="text-align:left">System Specification</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align:left">limited to how the system behaves in normal working conditions</td>
                <td style="text-align:left">can also include details on how it will fail gracefully when pushed beyond limits, how to recover, etc. specification</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align:left">written in terms of problems that need to be solved (e.g. provide a method to locate an email quickly)</td>
                <td style="text-align:left">written in terms of how the system solve those problems (e.g. explain the email search feature)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align:left">specifies the interface available for intended end-users</td>
                <td style="text-align:left">could contain additional APIs not available for end-users (for the use of developers/testers)</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>However, <strong>in many cases one document serves as both a requirement specification and a system specification.</strong></p>
      </tip-box>
      <p><strong>Passing system tests does not necessarily mean passing acceptance testing.</strong> Some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The system might work on the testbed environments but might not work the same way in the deployment environment, due to subtle differences between the two environments.</li>
        <li>The system might conform to the system specification but could fail to solve the problem it was supposed to solve for the user, due to flaws in the system design.</li>

                  <p>(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)<s>(f)</s></p>
                  <p>Explanation:</p>
                  <p>(b) is correct because system testing can aim to cover all specified behaviors and can even go beyond the system specification. Therefore, system testing is typically more extensive than acceptance testing.</p>
                  <p>(f) is incorrect because it is possible for a system to pass system tests but fail acceptance tests.</p>
