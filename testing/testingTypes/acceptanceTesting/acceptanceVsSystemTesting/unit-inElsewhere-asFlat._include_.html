<p>Acceptance testing comes after system testing. Similar to system testing, acceptance testing involves testing the whole system.</p>
<p>Some differences between system testing and acceptance testing:</p>
<div class="table-responsive"><table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped"><thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">System Testing</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Acceptance Testing</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Done against the system specification</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Done against the requirements specification</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Done by testers of the project team</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Done by a team that represents the customer</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Done on the development environment or a test bed</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Done on the deployment site or on a close simulation of the deployment site</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Both negative and positive test cases</td>
<td style="text-align:left">More focus on positive test cases</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><span class="dimmed">Note: <em>negative</em> test cases: cases where the SUT is not expected to work normally e.g. incorrect inputs; <em>positive</em> test cases: cases where the SUT is expected to work normally</span></p>
<box>
<p><strong>Requirement specification versus system specification</strong></p>
<p>The requirement specification need not be the same as the system specification. Some example differences:</p>
<div class="table-responsive"><table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped"><thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Requirements specification</th>
<th style="text-align:left">System specification</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">limited to how the system behaves in normal working conditions</td>
<td style="text-align:left">can also include details on how it will fail gracefully when pushed beyond limits, how to recover, etc. specification</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">written in terms of problems that need to be solved (e.g. provide a method to locate an email quickly)</td>
<td style="text-align:left">written in terms of how the system solves those problems (e.g. explain the email search feature)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">specifies the interface available for intended end-users</td>
<td style="text-align:left">could contain additional APIs not available for end-users (for the use of developers/testers)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>However, <strong>in many cases one document serves as both a requirement specification and a system specification.</strong></p></box>
<p><strong>Passing system tests does not necessarily mean passing acceptance testing.</strong> Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system might work on the testbed environments but might not work the same way in the deployment environment, due to subtle differences between the two environments.</li>
<li>The system might conform to the system specification but could fail to solve the problem it was supposed to solve for the user, due to flaws in the system design.</li></ul></div>

<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> a. Both system testing and acceptance testing typically involve the whole system.</li>

<template #answer><div>
<p>(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)<s>(f)</s></p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>(b) is correct because system testing can aim to cover all specified behaviors and can even go beyond the system specification. Therefore, system testing is typically more extensive than acceptance testing.</p>
<p>(f) is incorrect because it is possible for a system to pass system tests but fail acceptance tests.</p></div></template></question></panel></div></panel></div></div></div></div>
