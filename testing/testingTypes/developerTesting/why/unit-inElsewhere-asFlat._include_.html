<p><strong>Delaying testing until the full product is complete has a number of disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locating the cause of a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space;</strong> in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due to multiple inter-related bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated from the design or during requirements specification <span class="dimmed">i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements</span>.</li>
<li><strong>One bug might 'hide' other bugs</strong>, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
<li><strong>The delivery may have to be delayed</strong> if too many bugs are found during testing.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Therefore, it is better to do early testing</strong>, as hinted by the popular rule of thumb given below, also illustrated by the graph below it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earlier a bug is found, the easier and cheaper to have it fixed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such early testing of partially developed software is usually, and by necessity, done by the developers themselves i.e. developer testing.</p></div>

<question has-input="true">
<p>Discuss the pros and cons of developers testing their own code.</p>
<template #answer><div>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be done early (the earlier we find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix).</li>
<li>Can be done at lower levels, for example, at the operation and class levels (testers usually test the system at the UI level).</li>
<li>It is possible to do more thorough testing because developers know the expected external behavior as well as the internal structure of the component.</li>
<li>It forces developers to take responsibility for their own work (they cannot claim that &quot;testing is the job of the testers&quot;).</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A developer may subconsciously only test situations that he knows to work (i.e. test it too 'gently').</li>
<li>A developer may be blind to his own mistakes (if he did not consider a certain combination of input while writing the code, it is possible for him to miss it again during testing).</li>
<li>A developer may have misunderstood what the SUT is supposed to do in the first place.</li>
<li>A developer may lack the testing expertise.</li></ul></div></template></question></panel></div>

<question>
<p>The cost of fixing a bug goes down as we reach the product release.</p>
