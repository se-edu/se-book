<div id="body">

**_Dogfooding_ is when creators use their own product** in order to experience how end users experience the product. The term is supposedly derived from the phrase "eating our own dogfood". Dogfooding is different from regular testing in that you _become_ an end user, rather than _pretend to be_ an end user.

For example, suppose a company produces an email client software. Then, getting some of the employees to use that software for their day-to-day emailing would be dogfooding. Such longer-term, consistent, and authentic use of the software can point to areas of improvement that regular testing (which is often short-term and 'simulated') might not encounter.

Note that dogfooding to be useful, observations need to be deliberately collected and processed i.e., just using the product itself is not enough.
