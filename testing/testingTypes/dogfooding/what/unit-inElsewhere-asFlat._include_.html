<p><strong><em>Dogfooding</em> is when creators use their own product</strong> in order to experience how end users experience the product. The term is supposedly derived from the phrase &quot;eating our own dogfood&quot;. Dogfooding is different from regular testing in that you <em>become</em> an end user, rather than <em>pretend to be</em> an end user.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a company produces an email client software. Then, getting some of the employees to use that software for their day-to-day emailing would be dogfooding. Such longer-term, consistent, and authentic use of the software can point to areas of improvement that regular testing (which is often short-term and 'simulated') might not encounter.</p>
<p>Note that dogfooding to be useful, observations need to be deliberately collected and processed i.e., just using the product itself is not enough.</p></div>
