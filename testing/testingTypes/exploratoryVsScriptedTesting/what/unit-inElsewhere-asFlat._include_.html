<p><strong>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software: <em>Scripted</em> testing and <em>Exploratory</em> testing.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong>  First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p></li></ol>
<p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’ <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em> because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where more faults are found.</p>

<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; you need to look at them soon.
But before that, you should give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works, even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, you have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p></blockquote></box>

<question>
<p>Scripted testing requires tests to be written in a scripting language; manual testing is called exploratory testing.</p>
<ul radio-group="1baea" class="radio-list">
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="1baea" type="radio"> True</label></li>
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="1baea" type="radio"> False</label></li></ul>
<template #answer><div>
<p>False</p>
<p>Explanation: “Scripted” means test cases are predetermined. They need not be an executable script. However, exploratory testing is usually manual.</p></div></template></question></panel></div>

<p>Explain the concept of exploratory testing using Minesweeper as an example.</p>
<template #answer><div>
<p>When we test Minesweeper by simply playing it in various ways, especially trying out those that are likely to be buggy, that would be exploratory testing.</p></div></template></question></panel></div></panel></div></div></div></div>
