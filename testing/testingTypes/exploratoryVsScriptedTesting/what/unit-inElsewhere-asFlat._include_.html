      <p><strong>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software: <em>Scripted</em> testing and <em>Exploratory</em> testing</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong> First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’
        <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>        because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations
        where more faults are found.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works,
            even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>💡 <strong>Exploratory testing is also known as <em>reactive testing, error guessing technique, attack-based testing,</em> and <em>bug hunting</em>.</strong></p>

              <question>
                <p>Scripted testing requires tests to be written in a scripting language; Manual testing is called exploratory testing.</p>

                  <p>Explanation: “Scripted” means test cases are predetermined. They need not be an executable script. However, exploratory testing is usually manual.</p>
