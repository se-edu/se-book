    <p>In system testing we take the <em>whole system</em> and test it <em>against the system specification</em>.</p>
    <p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
    <p>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system. Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails ‘gracefully’ having pushed beyond its limits.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>Take the example of an SUT (software under test) that is a browser capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. A test case can involve loading a web page containing more than 5000 characters. The expected ‘graceful’ behavior
        would be to ‘abort the loading of the page and show a meaningful error message’. This test case would fail if the browser attempted to load the large file anyway and crashed.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>System testing includes testing against non-functional requirements too. Here are some examples.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Performance testing</em> – to ensure the system responds quickly.</li>
      <li><em>Load testing</em> (also called <em>stress testing</em> or <em>scalability testing</em>) – to ensure the system can work under heavy load.</li>
      <li><em>Security testing</em> – to test how secure the system is.</li>
      <li><em>Compatibility testing, interoperability testing</em> – to check whether the system can work with other systems.</li>
      <li><em>Usability testing</em> – to test how easy it is to use the system.</li>
      <li><em>Portability testing</em> – to test whether the system works on different platforms.</li>
    </ul>
