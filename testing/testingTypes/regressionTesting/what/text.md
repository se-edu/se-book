**When we modify a system, the modification may result in some unintended and undesirable effects on the system. Such an effect is called a _regression_.**

**_Regression testing_ is re-testing the <trigger for="pop:sut">SUT</trigger> to detect regressions.** Noted that to detect regressions, we need to retest all related components, even if they were tested before. 

Regression testing is more effective when it is done frequently, after each small change. However, doing so can be prohibitively expensive if testing is done manually. Hence, **regression testing is more practical when it is automated**.
