**Measuring coverage is often done using _coverage analysis tools_.** Most IDEs have inbuilt support for measuring test coverage, or at least have plugins that can measure test coverage.

**Coverage analysis can be useful in improving the quality of testing** %%e.g., if a set of test cases does not achieve 100% branch coverage, more test cases can be added to cover missed branches%%.
