**_Test coverage_ is a metric used to measure the extent to which testing exercises the code** i.e., how much of the code is 'covered' by the tests. 

Here are some examples of different coverage criteria:

* **Function/method coverage** : based on functions executed %%e.g., testing executed 90 out of 100 functions%%.
* **Statement coverage** : based on the number of lines of code executed %%e.g., testing executed 23k out of 25k LOC%%.
* **Decision/branch coverage** : based on the decision points exercised %%e.g., an `if` statement evaluated to both `true` and `false` with separate test cases during testing is considered 'covered'%%.
* **Condition coverage** : based on the boolean sub-expressions, each evaluated to both true and false with different test cases. Condition coverage is not the same as the decision coverage.

{{ icon_example }} `if(x > 2 && x < 44)` is considered one decision point but two conditions. 

For 100% branch or decision coverage, two test cases are required:

  * `(x > 2 && x < 44) == true` :  [e.g. `x == 4`]
  * `(x > 2 && x < 44) == false` :  [e.g. `x == 100`]

For 100% condition coverage, three test cases are required:

  * `(x > 2) == true` , `(x < 44) == true` : [e.g. `x == 4`] <sup>%%[see note 1]%%</sup>
  * `(x < 44) == false` : [e.g. `x == 100`]
  * `(x > 2) == false` : [e.g. `x == 0`]

Note 1: A case where both conditions are `true` is needed because most execution environments use a _short circuiting_ behavior for compound boolean expressions e.g., given an expression `c1 && c2`, `c2` will not be evaluated if `c1` is `false` (as the final result is going to be `false` anyway).

* **Path coverage** measures coverage in terms of possible paths through a given part of the code executed. 100% path coverage means all possible paths have been executed. A commonly used notation for path analysis is called the _Control Flow Graph (CFG)_. 
* **Entry/exit coverage** measures coverage in terms of possible _calls to_ and _exits_ from the operations in the SUT.
