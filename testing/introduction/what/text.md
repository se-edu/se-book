**When testing, you execute a set of _test cases_.** A test case specifies how to perform a test. At a minimum, it specifies the input to the _software under test (SUT)_ and the expected behavior.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Example: A minimal test case for testing a browser:

* **Input** – Start the browser using a blank page (vertical scrollbar disabled). Then, load `longfile.html` located in the `test data` folder.
* **Expected behavior** – The scrollbar should be automatically enabled upon loading `longfile.html`.

</box>

**Test cases can be determined based on the specification, reviewing similar existing systems, or comparing to the past behavior of the SUT.**

A more elaborate test case can have other details such as those given below.

* A unique identifier : %%e.g. TC0034-a%%
* A descriptive name: %%e.g. vertical scrollbar activation for long web pages%%
* Objectives: %%e.g. to check whether the vertical scrollbar is correctly activated when a long web page is loaded to the browser%%
* Classification information: %%e.g. priority - medium, category - UI features%%
* Cleanup, if any: %%e.g. empty the browser cache.%%

</panel><p/>

For each test case you should do the following:

1. Feed the input to the SUT
2. Observe the actual output
3. Compare actual output with the expected output

**A test case _failure_ is a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior. A failure indicates a potential _defect_ (or a bug)**, unless the error is in the test case itself.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Example: In the browser example above, a test case failure is implied if the scrollbar remains disabled after loading `longfile.html`. The defect/bug causing that failure could be an uninitialized variable.

Here is another definition of testing:

> Software testing consists of the _dynamic_ verification that a program provides _expected_ behaviors on a _finite_ set of test cases, suitably _selected_ from the usually infinite execution domain. <sub>-– source: [Software Engineering Book of Knowledge V3](https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3)</sub>

Some things to note (indicated by keywords in the above definition):

* _Dynamic_: Testing involves executing the software. It is not by examining the code statically.
* _Finite_: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.
* _Selected_: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.
* _Expected_: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.
