<p>Note that TDD does not imply writing all the test cases first before writing functional code. Rather, proceed in small steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide what behavior to implement.</li>
<li>Write/modify a test case to test that behavior.</li>
<li>Run the test cases and watch them fail.</li>
<li>Implement the behavior.</li>
<li>Run the test cases.</li>
<li>Keep modifying the code and rerunning test cases until they all pass.</li>
<li>Refactor code to improve quality.</li>
<li>Repeat the cycle for each small unit of behavior that needs to be implemented.</li></ol>
<p>Some TDD proponents cite the following as the three rules of TDD, that once again emphasize the need to proceed in very small steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.</li></ol></div>
