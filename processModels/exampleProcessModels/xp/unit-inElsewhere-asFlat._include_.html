<p><strong>Extreme Programming (XP) stresses customer satisfaction.</strong> Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it.</p>
<p><strong>XP aims to empower developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements</strong>, even late in the life cycle.</p>
<p><strong>XP emphasizes teamwork.</strong> Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. XP implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around the problem to solve it as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p><strong>XP aims to improve a software project in five essential ways: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage.</strong> Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design simple and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. Every small success deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every team member. With this foundation, Extreme Programmers are able to courageously respond to changing requirements and technology.</p>
<p><strong>XP has a set of simple rules.</strong> XP is a lot like a jig saw puzzle with many small pieces. Individually the pieces make no sense, but when combined together a complete picture can be seen. This flow chart shows how Extreme Programming's rules work together.</p>
