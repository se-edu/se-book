<p>CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is a process improvement approach defined by Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Melon University. CMMI provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes, which will improve their performance. <sub>-- adapted from <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/</a></sub></p></box>
<p><strong>CMMI defines five maturity levels for a process and provides criteria to determine if the process of an organization is at a certain maturity level.</strong> The diagram below [taken from Wikipedia] gives an overview of the five levels.</p>
