<p><strong>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC.</strong> Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirements gathering to testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p>

<p><strong>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product.</strong> Feedback on the new version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable version from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization, etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.</p>
<p><strong>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>breadth-first</strong>: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel <span class="dimmed">e.g., add a new feature fully, or enhance an existing feature</span>.</li>
<li><strong>depth-first</strong>: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components <span class="dimmed">e.g., update the backend to support a new feature that will be added in a future iteration</span>.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Most projects use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations</strong> <span class="dimmed">i.e., an iteration can contain some breadth-first work as well as some depth-first work</span>.</p></div>
