<p><strong>The iterative model advocates producing the software by going through several <em>iterations</em>.</strong> Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the stages of the SDLC, from requirements gathering to deployment.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Each iteration produces a new version of the product</strong>, building upon the version produced in the previous iteration. Feedback from each iteration is factored into the subsequent iterations. For example, if an implementation task took longer than  expected, the effort estimate for a similar tasks in future iterations can be adjusted accordingly. Similarly, if a feature introduced in the current iteration was not well-received by target users, it can be removed or tweaked in the next iteration.</p>
<p><strong>The iterative model can be done in <em>breadth-first</em> or <em>depth-first</em> approach.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In the breadth-first approach, an iteration evolves all major components and all functionality areas in parallel</strong> <span class="dimmed">i.e., most features and most <tooltip><template #content>i.e., the parts the software is divided into e.g., user interface, back-end, database etc.</template>components</tooltip> will be updated in each iteration</span>, producing a working product at the end of each iteration.</li>
<li><strong>In the depth-first approach, an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components or some functionality area.</strong> Accordingly, early depth-first iterations might not produce a working product.</li></ul>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Taking a Minesweeper game as an example,</p>
<ul>
<li>breadth-first iterations will deliver a fully playable version early. These early versions may have primitive functionality, for example, a rudimentary text based UI, fixed board size, limited minefield layouts, etc. These functionalities (and corresponding components) will then be improved in later releases.</li>
<li>an early depth-first iteration could deliver the full user interface (UI) but with no game logic at all. Alternatively, an early iteration could focus on just the logic for generating initial layouts of the minefield. Neither will be a playable version of the game but both can be used to collect early feedback (about the UI, and the initial minefield layouts, respectively) which can then be used to guide later iterations.</li></ul></box>
<p><strong>A project can be done as a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations</strong> <span class="dimmed">i.e., an iteration can contain some breadth-first work as well as some depth-first work, or, some iterations can be breadth-first while others are depth-first</span>.</p></div>
