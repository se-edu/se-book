**The _sequential model_, also called the _waterfall_ model, views software development as a linear process**, in which the project is seen as progressing through the development stages. The name _waterfall_ stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).

**When one stage of the process is completed, it produces some artifacts to be used in the next stage**. For example, the requirements stage produces a comprehensive list of requirements, to be used in the design phase.

**A strict sequential model project moves only in the forward direction** i.e., each stage is completed before starting the next. For example, once the requirements stage is over, there is no provision for revising the requirements later.

**This model can work well for a project that produces software to solve a well-understood problem**, in which case the requirements can remain stable and the effort can be estimated accurately. Furthermore, as each stage has a well-defined outcome, it is easy to track the progress of the project because one can gauge the project progress by monitoring which stage the project is in.

**However, real-world projects often tackle problems that are not well-understood at the beginning**, making them unsuitable for this model. For example, target users of a software product may not be able to state their requirements accurately at the start of the project, if they have not used a similar product before.
