<p><strong>The <em>sequential model</em>, also called the <em>waterfall</em> model, views software development as a linear process</strong>, in which the project is seen as progressing through the development stages. The name <em>waterfall</em> stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).</p>

<p><strong>When one stage of the process is completed, it produces some artifacts to be used in the next stage</strong>. For example, the requirements stage produces a comprehensive list of requirements, to be used in the design phase.</p>
<p><strong>A strict sequential model project moves only in the forward direction</strong> i.e., each stage is completed before starting the next. For example, once the requirements stage is over, there is no provision for revising the requirements later.</p>
<p><strong>This model can work well for a project that produces software to solve a well-understood problem</strong>, in which case the requirements can remain stable and the effort can be estimated accurately. Furthermore, as each stage has a well-defined outcome, it is easy to track the progress of the project because one can gauge the project progress by monitoring which stage the project is in.</p>
<p><strong>However, real-world projects often tackle problems that are not well-understood at the beginning</strong>, making them unsuitable for this model. For example, target users of a software product may not be able to state their requirements accurately at the start of the project, if they have not used a similar product before.</p></div>
