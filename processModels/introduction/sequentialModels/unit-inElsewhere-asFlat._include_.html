      <p><strong>The <em>sequential model</em>, also called the <em>waterfall</em> model, models software development as a linear process</strong>, in which the project is seen as progressing steadily in one direction through the development stages. The
        name <em>waterfall</em> stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).</p>

      <p><strong>When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage.</strong> For example, upon completion of the requirement stage a comprehensive list of requirements is produced that will see no further
        modifications. A strict application of the sequential model would require each stage to be completed before starting the next.</p>
      <p><strong>This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable.</strong> In such cases, using the sequential model should result in a timely and systematic development effort, provided that all goes well. As each
        stage has a well-defined outcome, the progress of the project can be tracked with a relative ease.</p>
      <p><strong>The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and keep changing over time.</strong> One reason for this is that users are generally not aware of how a software
        application can be used without prior experience in using a similar application.</p>
