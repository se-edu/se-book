      <p>In 2001, a group of prominent software engineering practitioners met and brainstormed for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes that were used in most large projects at the time. This resulted in something
        called the <em>agile manifesto</em> (a vision statement of what they were looking to do).</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
        <p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
          <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
          <li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
          <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>
          <sub>Extract from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a></sub></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Subsequently, some of the signatories of the manifesto went on to create process models that try to follow it. These processes are collectively called agile processes. Some of the key features of agile approaches are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirements are prioritized based on the needs of the user, are clarified regularly (at times almost on a daily basis) with the entire project team, and are factored into the development schedule as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Instead of doing a very elaborate and detailed design and a project plan for the whole project, the team works based on a rough project plan and a high level design that evolves as the project goes on.</li>
        <li>Strong emphasis on complete transparency and responsibility sharing among the team members. The team is responsible together for the delivery of the product. Team members are accountable, and regularly and openly share progress with each other
          and with the user.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>There are a number of agile processes in the development world today. <em>eXtreme Programming (XP)</em> and <em>Scrum</em> are two of the well-known ones.</strong></p>
