**Software development goes through different stages such as _requirements, analysis, design, implementation_ and _testing_. These stages are collectively known as the _software development life cycle_ (SDLC).** There are several approaches, known as _software development life cycle models_ (also called _software process models_), that describe different ways to go through the SDLC. Each process model prescribes a 'roadmap' for the software developers to manage the development effort. The roadmap describes the aims of the development stages, the outcome of each stage, and the workflow i.e. the relationship between stages.
