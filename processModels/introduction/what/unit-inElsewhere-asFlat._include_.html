<p><strong>Software development goes through different stages such as <em>requirements, analysis, design, implementation</em> and <em>testing</em>. These stages are collectively known as the <em>software development lifecycle</em> (SDLC).</strong> There are several approaches, known as <em>software development lifecycle models</em> (also called <em>software process models</em>), that describe different ways to go through the SDLC. Each process model prescribes a 'roadmap' for the software developers to manage the development effort. The roadmap describes the aims of the development stages, the outcome of each stage, and the workflow i.e., the relationship between stages.</p></div>
