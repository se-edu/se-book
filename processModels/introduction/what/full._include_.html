    <p><strong>Software development goes through different stages such as <em>requirements, analysis, design, implementation</em> and <em>testing</em>.  These stages are collectively known as the <em>software development life cycle</em> (SDLC).</strong>      There are several approaches, known as <em>software development life cycle models</em> (also called <em>software process models</em>) that describe different ways to go through the SDLC. Each process model prescribes a &quot;roadmap&quot; for the
      software developers to manage the development effort. The roadmap describes the aims of the development stage(s), the artifacts or outcome of each stage as well as the workflow i.e. the relationship between stages.</p>
