**You can declare a class as _abstract_ when a class is merely a representation of commonalities among its subclasses** in which case it does not make sense to instantiate objects of that class.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} The `Animal` class that exists as a generalization of its subclasses `Cat`, `Dog`, `Horse`, `Tiger` etc. can be declared as abstract because it does not make sense to instantiate an `Animal` object.

</box>

<box type="definition" seamless>
<include src="../../../common/definitions.md#def-abstractMethod" trim />
</box>

<box>

{{ icon_example }} The `move` method of the `Animal` class is likely to be an abstract method as it is not possible to implement a `move` method at the `Animal` class level to fit all subclasses %%because each animal type can move in a different way%%.

</box>

**A class that has an abstract method becomes an abstract class** because the class definition is incomplete (due to the missing method body) and it is not possible to create objects using an incomplete class definition.
