      <p><strong>You can declare a class as <em>abstract</em> when a class is merely a representation of commonalities among its subclasses</strong> in which case it does not make sense to instantiate objects of that class.</p>

        <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The <code>move</code> method of the <code>Animal</code> class is likely to be an abstract method as it is not possible to implement a <code>move</code> method at the <code>Animal</code> class level to fit all subclasses <span class="dimmed">because each animal type can move in a different way</span>.</p>
      </box>
      <p><strong>A class that has an abstract method becomes an abstract class</strong> because the class definition is incomplete (due to the missing method body) and it is not possible to create objects using an incomplete class definition.</p>
