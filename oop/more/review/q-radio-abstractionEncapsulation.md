c

Explanation: We can have abstraction without encapsulation. For example, we can *think* in terms of student entities when we code in C (a procedural language). But when we use a language that has encapsulation too (e.g., in Java/C++/C#), we can package all student related data and functions into one construct (i.e., a class). This makes the ‘student’ abstraction stronger because now we can not only think in terms of students, the program can also perform actions using objects that represent student entities.
