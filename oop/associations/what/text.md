Objects in an OO solution need to be connected to each other to form a network so that they can interact with each other. Such **connections between objects are called _associations_.**

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Suppose an OOP program for managing a learning management system creates an object structure to represent the related objects. In that object structure you can expect to have associations between a `Course` object that represents a specific course and `Student` objects that represent students taking that course.

</box>

**Associations in an object structure can change over time**.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} To continue the previous example, the associations between a `Course` object and `Student` objects can change as students enroll in the course or drop the course over time.

</box>

**Associations among objects can be generalized as associations between the corresponding classes too.**

<box>

{{ icon_example }} In our example, as some `Course` objects can have associations with some `Student` objects, you can view it as an association between the `Course` class and the `Student` class.

</box>

##### Implementing associations

**You use instance level variables to implement associations.**
