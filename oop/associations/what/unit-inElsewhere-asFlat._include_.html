<p>Objects in an OO solution need to be connected to each other to form a network so that they can interact with each other. Such <strong>connections between objects are called <em>associations</em>.</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Suppose an OOP program for managing a learning management system creates an object structure to represent the related objects. In that object structure you can expect to have associations between a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Course</code> object that represents a specific course and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Student</code> objects that represent students taking that course.</p></box>
<p><strong>Associations in an object structure can change over time</strong>.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> To continue the previous example, the associations between a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Course</code> object and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Student</code> objects can change as students enroll in the module or drop the module over time.</p></box>
<p><strong>Associations among objects can be generalized as associations between the corresponding classes too.</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> In our example, as some <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Course</code> objects can have associations with some <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Student</code> objects, you can view it as an association between the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Course</code> class and the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Student</code> class.</p></box>

<p><strong>You use instance level variables to implement associations.</strong></p></div>
