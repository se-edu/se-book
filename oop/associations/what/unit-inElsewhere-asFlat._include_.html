      <p>Objects in an OO solution need to be connected to each other to form a network so that they can interact with each other. Such <strong>connections between objects are called <em>associations</em>.</strong></p>
      <box>
        <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Suppose an OOP program for managing a learning management system creates an object structure to represent the related objects. In that object structure we can expect to have associations between a<code>Course</code> object that represents a specific course and <code>Student</code> objects that represent students taking that course.</p>
      </box>
      <p><strong>Associations in an object structure can change over time</strong>.</p>
      <box>
        <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> To continue the previous example, the associations between a <code>Course</code> object and <code>Student</code> objects can change as students enroll in the module or drop the module over time.</p>
      </box>
      <p><strong>Associations among objects can be generalized as associations between the corresponding classes too.</strong></p>
      <box>
        <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> In our example, as some <code>Course</code> objects can have associations with some <code>Student</code> objects, we can view it as an association between the <code>Course</code> class and the <code>Student</code> class.</p>
