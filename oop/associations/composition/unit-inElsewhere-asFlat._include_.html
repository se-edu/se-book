<p><strong>A composition is an association that represents a strong <em>whole-part</em> relationship.</strong> When the <em>whole</em> is destroyed, <em>parts</em> are destroyed too i.e., the <em>part</em> should not exist without being attached to a <em>whole</em>.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> A <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Board</code> (used for playing board games) consists of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Square</code> objects.</p></box>
<p><strong>Composition also implies that there cannot be cyclical links</strong>.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The ‘sub-folder’ association between <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Folder</code> objects is a composition type association. That means if the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Folder</code> object <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>foo</code> is a sub-folder of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Folder</code> object <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>bar</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>bar</code> cannot be a sub-folder of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>foo</code>.</p></box>
<p><strong>Whether a relationship is a composition can depend on the context</strong>.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Is the relationship between <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Email</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>EmailSubject</code> composition? That is, is the email subject <em>part</em> of an email to the extent that an email subject cannot exist without an email?</p>
<ul>
<li>When modeling an application that sends emails, the answer is 'yes'.</li>
<li>When modeling an application that gather analytics about email traffic, the answer may be 'no' <span class="dimmed">(e.g., the application might collect just the email subjects for text analysis)</span>.</li></ul></box>
<p><strong>A common use of composition is when parts of a big class are carved out as smaller classes</strong> for the ease of managing the internal design. In such cases, the classes extracted out still act as <em>parts</em> of the bigger class and the outside world has no business knowing about them.</p>
<p><strong>Cascading deletion alone is not sufficient for composition.</strong> Suppose there is a design in which <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Person</code> objects are attached to <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Task</code> objects and the former get deleted whenever the latter is deleted. This fact alone does not mean there is a composition relationship between the two classes. For it to be composition, a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Person</code> must be an integral <em>part</em> of a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Task</code> in the context of that association, at the concept level (not simply at implementation level).</p>
<p><strong>Identifying and keeping track of composition relationships in the design has benefits</strong> such as helping to maintain the data integrity of the system. For example, when you know that a certain relationship is a composition, you can take extra care in your implementation to ensure that when the <em>whole</em> object is deleted, all its <em>parts</em> are deleted too.</p>

<p><strong>Composition is implemented using a normal variable.</strong> If correctly implemented, the ‘part’ object will be deleted when the ‘whole’ object is deleted. Ideally, the ‘part’ object may not even be visible to clients of the ‘whole’ object.</p>
