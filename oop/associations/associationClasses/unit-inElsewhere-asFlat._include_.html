      <p><strong>An <em>association class</em> represents additional information about an association.</strong> It is a normal class but plays a special role from a design point of view.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> A <code>Man</code> class and a <code>Woman</code> class is linked with a ‘married to’ association and there is a need to store the date of marriage. However, that data is related to the association rather than
          specifically owned by either the <code>Man</code> object or the <code>Woman</code> object. In such situations, an additional association class can be introduced, e.g. a <code>Marriage</code> class, to store such information.</p>
      </tip-box>
      <h5 id="implementing-association-classes"><big>Implementing association classes</big></h5>
      <p>There is no special way to implement an association class. It can be implemented as a normal class that has variables to represent the endpoint of the association it represents.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> In the code below, the <code>Transaction</code> class is an association class that represent a transaction between a <code>Person</code> who is the seller and another <code>Person</code> who is the buyer.</p>

                  <p>Explanation: Mileage is a property of the car, and not specifically about the association between the Driver and the Car. If Mileage was defined as the total number of miles that car was driven by that driver, then it would be suitable
                    as an association class.</p>
