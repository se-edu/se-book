**Writing an OOP program is essentially writing instructions that the computer will use to,**
 1. **create the virtual world of the object network, and**
 2. **provide it the inputs to produce the outcome you want.**

**A ==_class_== contains instructions for creating a specific kind of objects**. It turns out sometimes multiple objects keep the same type of data and have the same behavior because they are of the _same kind_. Instructions for creating a 'kind' (or ‘class’) of objects can be done once and those same instructions can be used to <tooltip content="i.e. create instances of">_instantiate_</tooltip> objects of that kind. We call such instructions a _Class_.

{{ icon_example }} Classes and objects in an example scenario

Consider the example of writing an OOP program to calculate the average age of Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy.

Instructions for creating objects `Adam`, `Beth`, `Charlie`, and `Daisy` will be very similar because they are all of the same kind: they all represent ‘persons’ with the same interface, the same kind of data (i.e. `name`, `dateOfBirth`, etc.), and the same kind of behavior (i.e. `getAge(Date)`, `getName()`, etc.). Therefore, you can have a class called `Person` containing instructions on how to create `Person` objects and use that class to instantiate objects `Adam`, `Beth`, `Charlie`, and `Daisy`.

Similarly, you need classes `AgeList`, `Calculator`, and `Main` classes to instantiate one each of `AgeList`, `Calculator`, and `Main` objects.

Class | Objects
------|--------
`Person`| objects representing Adam, Beth, Charlie, Daisy
`AgeList` | an object to represent the age list
`Calculator` | an object to do the calculations
`Main` | an object to represent you (i.e., the one who manages the whole operation)
