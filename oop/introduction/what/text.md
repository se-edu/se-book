**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a _programming paradigm_.** A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way.

> Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting state of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.
>
> This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background against which you work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.
>
> With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures are the basic elements of design.
>
> Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form a complete program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.

Some other examples of programming paradigms are:

Paradigm | Programming Languages
-------- | ---------------------
[_Procedural Programming_ paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)| C
[_Functional Programming_ paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)| F#, Haskell, Scala
[_Logic Programming_ paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) | Prolog

**Some programming languages support multiple paradigms.**

{{ icon_example }} Java is primarily an OOP language but it supports limited forms of functional programming and it can be used to (although not recommended to) write procedural code. %%e.g. [se-edu/addressbook-level1](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level1)%%

{{ icon_example }} JavaScript and Python support functional, procedural, and OOP programming.
