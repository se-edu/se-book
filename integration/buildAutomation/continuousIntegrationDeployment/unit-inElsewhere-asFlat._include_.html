<p><strong>An extreme application of build automation is called <em>continuous integration (CI)</em> in which integration, building, and testing happens automatically after each code change.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A natural extension of CI is <em>Continuous Deployment (CD)</em> where the changes are not only integrated continuously, but also deployed to end-users at the same time.</strong></p>
