<question has-input="true">

Suggest an integration strategy for the system represented by the following diagram. You need not follow a strict top-down, bottom-up, sandwich, or big bang approach. Dashed arrows represent dependencies between classes.

Also take into account the following facts in your test strategy:

* `HospitalUI` will be developed early, so as to get customer feedback early.
* `HospitalFacade` shields the UI from the complexities of the application layer. It simply redirects the method calls received to the appropriate classes below.
* `IO_Helper` is to be reused from an earlier project, with minor modifications.
* Development of the `OutPatient` component has been outsourced, and its delivery is not expected until the 2nd half of the project.

There can be many acceptable answers to this question. But any good strategy should consider at least some of the following:

* Because `HospitalUI` will be developed early, itâ€™s OK to integrate it early, using stubs, rather than wait for the rest of the system to finish. (i.e. a top-down integration is suitable for `HospitalUI`)
* Because `HospitalFacade` is unlikely to have a lot of business logic, it may not be worth to write stubs to test it (i.e. a bottom-up integration is better for `HospitalFacade`).
* Because `IO_Helper` is to be reused from an earlier project, you can finish it early. This is especially suitable since there are many classes that use it. Therefore `IO_Helper` can be integrated with the dependent classes in bottom-up fashion.
* Because the `OutPatient` class may be delayed, you may have to integrate `PatientMgr` using a stub.
* `TypeA`, `TypeB`, and `TypeC` seem to be tightly coupled. It may be a good idea to test them together.

Given below is one possible integration test strategy. The relative positioning of items is used to indicate a rough timeline.
