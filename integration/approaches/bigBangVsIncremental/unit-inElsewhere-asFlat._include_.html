<p><strong><em>Big-bang integration</em>: integrate all (or too many) components at the same time.</strong> More generally, integrating too many changes at the same time.</p>
<box type="wrong">
<p>Big-bang is not recommended because it will uncover too many problems at the same time which could make debugging and bug-fixing more complex than when problems are uncovered incrementally.</p></box>
<p><strong><em>Incremental integration</em>: integrate a few components at a time.</strong> More generally, integrating changes gradually. This approach is better than big-bang integration because it surfaces integration problems in a more manageable way.</p></div>

<p>Give two arguments in support and two arguments against the following statement.</p>
<p><em>Because there is no external client, it is OK to use big bang integration for a school project.</em></p>
<panel type="seamless" minimized><template #header><p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span></span> Answer</p></template>
<p>Arguments for:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is relatively simple; even big-bang can succeed.</li>
<li>Project duration is short; there is not enough time to integrate in steps.</li>
<li>The system is non-critical, non-production (demo only); the cost of integration issues is relatively small.</li></ul>
<p>Arguments against:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inexperienced developers; big-bang more likely to fail.</li>
<li>Too many problems may be discovered too late. Submission deadline (fixed) can be missed.</li>
<li>Team members have not worked together before; increases the probability of integration problems.</li></ul></panel></panel></div></div></div></div></div></div>
