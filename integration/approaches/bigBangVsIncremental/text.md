<span id="outcomes">{{ icon_outcome }} Can explain how integration approaches vary based on amount merged at a time</span>

<div id="body">

**_Big-bang integration_: integrate all (or too many) components at the same time.** More generally, integrating too many changes at the same time.

<box type="wrong">

Big-bang is not recommended because it will uncover too many problems at the same time which could make debugging and bug-fixing more complex than when problems are uncovered incrementally.

</box>

**_Incremental integration_: integrate a few components at a time.** More generally, integrating changes gradually. This approach is better than big-bang integration because it surfaces integration problems in a more manageable way.
