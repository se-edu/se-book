        <p><strong>In terms of timing and frequency, there are two general approaches to integration: <em>late and one-time</em>, <em>early and frequent</em>.</strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>Late and one-time</em>: wait till all components are completed and integrate all finished components near the end of the project.</strong></p>
        <tip-box type="wrong">
          <p>This approach is not recommended because integration often causes many component incompatibilities (due to previous miscommunications and misunderstandings) to surface which can lead to delivery delays <span class="dimmed"> i.e. Late integration → incompatibilities found → major rework required → cannot meet the delivery date</span>.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <p><strong><em>Early and frequent</em>: integrate early and evolve each part in parallel, in small steps, re-integrating frequently.</strong></p>
        <tip-box>

              <tooltip content="it compiles and runs but does not produce any useful output">walking skeleton</tooltip>
            </em> can be written first. This can be done by one developer, possibly the one in charge of integration. After that, all developers can flesh out the skeleton in parallel, adding one feature at a time. After each feature is done, simply integrate the new code to the main system.</p>
