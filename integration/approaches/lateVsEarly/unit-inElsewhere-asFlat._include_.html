<p><strong>In terms of timing and frequency, there are two general approaches to integration: <em>late and one-time</em>, <em>early and frequent</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Late and one-time</em>: wait till all components are completed and integrate all finished components near the end of the project.</strong></p>
<box type="wrong">
<p>This approach is not recommended because integration often causes many component incompatibilities (due to previous miscommunications and misunderstandings) to surface which can lead to delivery delays <span class="dimmed">i.e. Late integration → incompatibilities found → major rework required → cannot meet the delivery date</span>.</p></box>
<p><strong><em>Early and frequent</em>: integrate early and evolve each part in parallel, in small steps, re-integrating frequently.</strong></p>

This can be done by one developer, possibly the one in charge of integration. After that, all developers can flesh out the skeleton in parallel, adding one feature at a time. After each feature is done, simply integrate the new code into the main system.</p></box></div>
