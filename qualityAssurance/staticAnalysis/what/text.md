Static analysis can find anomalies such as unused variables and unhandled exceptions. Detection of such anomalies helps in improving the code quality.   Most modern IDEs come with some inbuilt static analysis capabilities. For example, an IDE will highlight unused variables as you type the code into the editor. Higher-end static analyzers (e.g. CheckStyle for Java) can check for more complex (and sometimes user-defined) anomalies, such as overwriting a variable before its current value is used.
