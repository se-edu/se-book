    <p><strong>Quality Assurance = Validation + Verification</strong></p>
    <p>QA involves checking two aspects:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Building the right system, i.e. are the requirements correct? This is called <em>validation</em>.</li>
      <li>Building the system right, i.e. are the requirements implemented correctly? This is called <em>verification</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is both are done, instead of limiting to verification (i.e., remember that the requirements can be wrong too).</p>

                <p>Explanation:</p>
                <p>To quote the handout, “Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is that we do both”.</p>
                <p>Developer testing is more about bugs in code, rather than bugs in the requirements.</p>
                <p>In QA, system testing is more about verification (does the system follow the specification?) and acceptance testings is more about validation (does the system solve the user’s problem?). A system crash is more likely to be a bug in the
                  code, not in the requirements.</p>
