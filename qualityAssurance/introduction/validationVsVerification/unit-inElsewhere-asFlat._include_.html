      <p><strong>Quality Assurance = Validation + Verification</strong></p>
      <p>QA involves checking two aspects:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Validation: are we <em>building the right system</em> i.e., are the requirements correct?</li>
        <li>Verification: are we <em>building the system right</em> i.e., are the requirements implemented correctly?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is both are done, instead of limiting to verification (i.e., remember that the requirements can be wrong too).</p>

                  <p>Explanation:</p>
                  <p>Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is that we do both.</p>
                  <p>Developer testing is more about bugs in code, rather than bugs in the requirements.</p>
                  <p>In QA, system testing is more about verification (does the system follow the specification?) and acceptance testings is more about validation (does the system solve the user’s problem?).</p>
                  <p>A system crash is more likely to be a bug in the code, not in the requirements.</p>
