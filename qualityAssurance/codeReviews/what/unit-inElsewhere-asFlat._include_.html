      <p><strong>Code review is the systematic examination code with the intention of finding where the code can be improved.</strong></p>
      <p>Reviews can be done in various forms. Some examples below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>In <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:codeReview-pairProgramming">pair programming</trigger></strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>As pair programming involves two programmers working on the same code at the same time, there is an implicit review of the code by the other member of the pair.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

            <p><strong>Pair Programming</strong>:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.
                The two programmers switch roles frequently. <sub>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">source: Wikipedia</a>]</sub></p>

          <p><strong>Pull Request reviews</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Project Management Platforms such as GitHub and BitBucket allows the new code to be proposed as Pull Requests and provides the ability for others to review the code in the PR.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Formal inspections</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Inspections involve a group of people systematically examining a project artifacts to discover defects. Members of the inspection team play various roles during the process, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the author - the creator of the artifact</li>
                <li>the moderator - the planner and executor of the inspection meeting</li>
                <li>the secretary - the recorder of the findings of the inspection</li>
                <li>the inspector/reviewer - the one who inspects/reviews the artifact.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Advantages of code reviews over testing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It can detect functionality defects as well as other problems such as coding standard violations.</li>
        <li>Can verify non-code artifacts and incomplete code</li>
        <li>Do not require test drivers or stubs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disadvantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is a manual process and therefore, error prone.</li>
