**Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is readability** (aka understandability). This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to be read, understood, and modified by other developers later on. Even if you do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because you will become a 'stranger' to your own code someday.
