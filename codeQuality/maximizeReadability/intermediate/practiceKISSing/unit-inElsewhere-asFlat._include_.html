<p><strong>Do not try to write ‘clever’ code. &quot;Keep it simple, stupid” (KISS)</strong>, as the old adage goes. For example, do not dismiss the brute-force yet simple solution in favor of a complicated one because of some ‘supposed benefits’ such as 'better reusability' unless you have a strong justification.</p>

Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. <span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-quote-right"></span></span> <sub>-- Brian W.
