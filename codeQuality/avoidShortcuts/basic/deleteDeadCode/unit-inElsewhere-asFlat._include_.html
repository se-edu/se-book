<p>You might feel reluctant to delete code you have painstakingly written, even if you have no use for that code anymore (&quot;I spent a lot of time writing that code; what if I need it again?&quot;). Consider all code as baggage you have to carry; get rid of unused code the moment it becomes redundant. If you need that code again, simply recover it from the revision control tool you are using. Deleting code you wrote previously is a sign that you are improving.</p></div>
