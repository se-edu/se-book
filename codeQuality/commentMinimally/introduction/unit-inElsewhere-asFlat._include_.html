<p>Good code is its own best documentation. As you’re about to add a comment, ask yourself, ‘How can I improve the code so that this comment isn’t needed?’ Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer. <sub>-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McConnell">Steve McConnell</a>, Author of <em>Clean Code</em></sub></p></blockquote>
<p>Some think commenting heavily increases the 'code quality'. That is not so. Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Improve the code to make it self-explanatory.</p></div>
