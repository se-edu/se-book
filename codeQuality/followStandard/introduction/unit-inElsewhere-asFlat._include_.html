<p><strong>One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow a strict coding standard (aka <em>style guide</em>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person</strong>. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the locations of opening and closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use <em>Hungarian style</em>, <em>Pascal casing</em>, <em>Camel casing</em>, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company uses the same coding standard and that the standard is generally not inconsistent with typical industry practices. <span class="dimmed">If a company's coding standard is very different from what is typically used in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.</span></p>
<p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-warning text-dark"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> IDEs can help to enforce some parts of a coding standard e.g. indentation rules.</p></div>
