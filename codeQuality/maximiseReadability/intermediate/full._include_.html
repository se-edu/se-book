          <p>Lay out the code so that it adheres to the logical structure. The code should read like a story. Just like we use section breaks, chapters and paragraphs to organize a story, use classes, methods, indentation and line spacing in your code to
            group related segments of the code. For example, you can use blank lines to group related statements together. Sometimes, the correctness of your code does not depend on the order in which you perform certain intermediary steps. Nevertheless,
            this order may affect the clarity of the story you are trying to tell. Choose the order that makes the story most readable.</p>

          <p><strong>Optimizing code prematurely has several drawbacks</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>We may not know which parts are the real performance bottlenecks</strong>. This is especially the case when the code undergoes transformations (e.g. compiling, minifying, transpiling, etc.) before it becomes an executable. Ideally,
              you should use a profiler tool to identify the actual bottlenecks of the code first, and optimize only those parts.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimizing can complicate the code</strong>, affecting correctness and understandability</li>
            <li><strong>Hand-optimized code can be harder for the compiler to optimize</strong> (the simpler the code, the easier for the compiler to optimize it). In many cases a compiler can do a better job of optimizing the runtime code if you don't get
              in the way by trying to hand-optimize the source code.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A popular saying in the industry is <strong><em>make it work, make it right, make it fast</em></strong> which means in most cases getting the code to perform correctly should take priority over optimizing it. If the code doesn't work correctly,
            it has no value on matter how fast/efficient it it.</p>

          <p>Note that <strong>there are cases where optimizing takes priority over other things</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g. when writing code for resource-constrained environments</span>. This guideline simply a caution that you should optimize only
            when it is really needed.</p>

          <p>Avoid varying the level of abstraction within a code fragment. Note: The <em>Productive Programmer</em> (by Neal Ford) calls this the <em>SLAP principle</em> i.e. Single Level of Abstraction Per method.</p>

              <p><strong>Abstraction</strong>:</p>
              <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only details
                that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand. For example, within a certain software component, we might deal with a ‘user’ data type, while ignoring the details contained in the user data item. These details have been
                ‘abstracted away’ as they do not affect the task of that software component. This is called <em>data abstraction</em>. On the other hand, <em>control abstraction</em> abstracts away details of the actual control flow to focus on tasks
                at a simplified level. For example, <code>print(“Hello”)</code> is an abstraction of the actual output mechanism within the computer.</p>
              <p>Abstraction can be applied repeatedly to obtain higher and <em>higher levels of abstractions</em>. For example, a <code>File</code> is a data item that is at a higher level than an array and an array is at a higher level than a bit. Similarly,
                <code>execute(Game)</code> is at a higher level than <code>print(Char)</code> which is at a higher than an Assembly language instruction <code>MOV</code>.</p>

              <p>Putting all details in one place can create lengthy methods, but it is preferred over creating many small methods because it makes the code easier to understand.</p>

                <p>Explanation: If you are using abstraction properly, you DON’T need to see all details to understand something. The whole point of using abstraction is to be able to understand things without knowing as little details as possible. This
                  is why we recommend single level of abstraction per method and top-down coding.</p>
