      <p>As the old adage goes, <strong>&quot;keep it simple, stupid” (KISS).  Do not try to write ‘clever’ code.</strong> For example, do not dismiss the brute-force yet simple solution in favor of a complicated one because of some ‘supposed benefits’ such
        as 'better reusability' unless you have a strong justification.</p>

          it. <span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-quote-right"></span></span> <sub>--Brian W. Kernighan </sub></p>
