      <p><strong>Optimizing code prematurely has several drawbacks</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We may not know which parts are the real performance bottlenecks</strong>. This is especially the case when the code undergoes transformations (e.g. compiling, minifying, transpiling, etc.) before it becomes an executable. Ideally, you should use a profiler tool to identify the actual bottlenecks of the code first, and optimize only those parts.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimizing can complicate the code</strong>, affecting correctness and understandability</li>
        <li><strong>Hand-optimized code can be harder for the compiler to optimize</strong> (the simpler the code, the easier for the compiler to optimize it). In many cases a compiler can do a better job of optimizing the runtime code if you don't get in the way by trying to hand-optimize the source code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A popular saying in the industry is <strong><em>make it work, make it right, make it fast</em></strong> which means in most cases getting the code to perform correctly should take priority over optimizing it. If the code doesn't work correctly, it has no value on matter how fast/efficient it it.</p>

      <p>Note that <strong>there are cases where optimizing takes priority over other things</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. when writing code for resource-constrained environments</span>. This guideline simply a caution that you should optimize only when it is really needed.</p>
