<p><strong>Use cases can be used for system testing and acceptance testing</strong>. For example, the main success scenario can be one test case while each variation (due to extensions) can form another test case. However, note that use cases do not specify the exact data entered into the system. Instead, it might say something like <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>user enters his personal data into the system</code>. Therefore, the tester has to choose data by considering equivalence partitions and boundary values. The combinations of these could result in one use case producing many test cases.</p>
<p>To increase the <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:usebaseBased-EandE">E&amp;E of testing</trigger>, high-priority use cases are given more attention. For example, a <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:usecaseBased-scripted">scripted approach</trigger> can be used to test high-priority test cases, while an exploratory approach is used to test other areas of concern that could emerge during testing.</p>

<p><strong>Every test case adds to the cost of testing.</strong> In some systems, a single test case can cost thousands of dollars <span class="dimmed">e.g. on-field testing of flight-control software</span>. Therefore, <strong>test cases need to be designed to make the best use of testing resources.</strong>  In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing should be <em>effective</em></strong> i.e., it finds a high percentage of existing bugs <span class="dimmed">e.g., a set of test cases that finds 60 defects is more effective than a set that finds only 30 defects in the same system</span>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing should be <em>efficient</em></strong> i.e., it has a high rate of success (bugs found/test cases) <span class="dimmed">a set of 20 test cases that finds 8 defects is more efficient than another set of 40 test cases that finds the same 8 defects</span>.</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>For testing to be <tooltip><template #content>Efficient and Effective</template>E&amp;E</tooltip>, each new test you add should be targeting a potential fault that is not already targeted by existing test cases.</strong> There are test case design techniques that can help us improve the E&amp;E of testing.</p></div></modal>

<p><strong>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software: <em>Scripted</em> testing and <em>Exploratory</em> testing.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong>  First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p></li></ol>
<p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’ <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em> because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where more faults are found.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; you need to look at them soon.
But before that, you should give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works, even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, you have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p></blockquote></box>

<question>
<p>Scripted testing requires tests to be written in a scripting language; manual testing is called exploratory testing.</p>
<ul radio-group="1baea" class="radio-list">
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="1baea" type="radio"> True</label></li>
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="1baea" type="radio"> False</label></li></ul>
<template #answer><div>
<p>False</p>
<p>Explanation: “Scripted” means test cases are predetermined. They need not be an executable script. However, exploratory testing is usually manual.</p></div></template></question></panel></div>

<p>When we test Minesweeper by simply playing it in various ways, especially trying out those that are likely to be buggy, that would be exploratory testing.</p></div></template></question></panel></div></panel></div></div></div></div></div></modal></div>
