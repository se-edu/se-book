<question has-input="true">

Given below is the overview of the method `dispatch(Resource, Task)`, from an emergency management system (e.g. a system used by those who handle emergency calls from the public about incidents such as fires, possible burglaries, domestic disturbances, etc.). A task might need multiple resources of multiple types. For example, the task ‘fire at Clementi MRT’ might need two fire engines and one ambulance.

* `dispatch(Resource r, Task t): void`
* Overview: This method dispatches the Resource `r` to the Task `t`. Since this can dispatch only one resource, it needs to be used multiple times should the task need multiple resources.

Imagine you are designing test cases to test the method `dispatch(Resource, Task)`. Taking into account equivalence partitions and boundary values, which different inputs will you combine to test the method?

      <ul>
        <li>A fully dispatched task</li>
        <li>A task requiring one more resource</li>
        <li>A task with no resources dispatched</li>
      </ul>
      Considering the resource types required
      <ul>
        <li>A task requiring only one type of resource</li>
        <li>A task requiring multiple types of resources</li>
        <li>null</li>
