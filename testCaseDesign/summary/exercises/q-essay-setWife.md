Partitioning ‘married’ as ‘to the same woman’ and ‘to a different woman’ seems redundant at first. Arguments for having it:

* The behavior (e.g. the error message shown) may be different in those two situations.
* The ‘to the same woman’ partition has a risk of misunderstanding between developer and user. For example, the developer might think it is OK to ignore the request while the users might expect to see an error message.
