      <p>Consider the testing of the following operation.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <div id="isValidMonth">
          <p><code>isValidMonth(m)</code> : returns <code>true</code> if <code>m</code> (and <code>int</code>) is in the range [1..12]</p>
        </div>
      </tip-box>
      <p>It is inefficient and impractical to test this method for all integer values <code>[-MIN_INT to MAX_INT]</code>. Fortunately, there is no need to test all possible input values. For example, if the input value <code>233</code> failed to produce
        the correct result, the input <code>234</code> is likely to fail too; there is no need to test both.</p>
      <p>In general, <strong>most SUTs do not treat each input in a unique way. Instead, they process all possible inputs in a small number of distinct ways.</strong> That means a range of inputs is treated the same way inside the SUT.
        <strong><em>Equivalence partitioning (EP)</em> is a test case design technique that uses the above observation to improve the E&amp;E of testing.</strong></p>
      <tip-box type="definition">
        <div>
          <p><strong>Equivalence partition (aka equivalence class)</strong>: A group of test inputs that are likely to be processed by the SUT in the same way.</p>
        </div>
      </tip-box>
      <p><strong>By dividing possible inputs into equivalence partitions we can,</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>avoid testing too many inputs from one partition.</strong> Testing too many inputs from the same partition is unlikely to find new bugs. This increases the efficiency of testing by reducing redundant test cases.</li>
        <li><strong>ensure all partitions are tested.</strong> Missing partitions can result in bugs going unnoticed. This increases the effectiveness of testing by increasing the chance of finding bugs.</li>
