<div id="body">

**_Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)_ is a test case design heuristic that is based on the observation that bugs often result from incorrect handling of boundaries of equivalence partitions.** This is not surprising, as the end points of boundaries are often used in branching instructions, etc., where the programmer can make mistakes.

{{ icon_example }} The `markCellAt(int x, int y)` operation could contain code such as `if (x > 0 && x <= (W-1))` which involves the boundaries of xâ€™s equivalence partitions.

</box>


**BVA suggests that when picking test inputs from an equivalence partition, values near boundaries (i.e., boundary values) are more likely to find bugs.**

Boundary values are sometimes called _corner cases_.
