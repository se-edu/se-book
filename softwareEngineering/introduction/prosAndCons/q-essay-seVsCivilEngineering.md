<question has-input="true">

Compare Software Engineering with Civil Engineering in terms of how work products in CE (i.e. buildings) differ from those of SE (i.e. software).

| Buildings                                                                                                             | Software                                                                                       |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Visible, tangible                                                                                                     | Invisible, intangible                                                                          |
| Wears out over time                                                                                                   | Does not wear out                                                                              |
| Change is limited by physical restrictions (e.g. difficult to remove a floor from a high rise building)               | Change is not limited by such restrictions. Just change the code and recompile.                |
| Creating an exact copy of a building is impossible. Creating a near copy is almost as costly as creating the original.| Any number of exact copies can be made with near zero cost.                                    |
| Difficult to move.                                                                                                    | Easily delivered from one place to another.                                                    |
| Many low-skilled workers following tried-and-tested procedures.                                                       | No low-skilled workers involved. Workers have more freedom to follow their own procedures.     |
| Easier to assure quality (just follow accepted procedure).                                                            | Not easy to assure quality.                                                                    |
| Majority of the work force has to be on location.                                                                     | Can be built by people who are not even in the same country.                                   |
| Raw materials are costly, costly equipment required.                                                                  | Almost free raw materials and relatively cheap equipment.                                      |
| Once construction is started, it is hard to do drastic changes to the design.                                         | Building process is very flexible. Drastic design changes can be done, although costly         |
| A lot of manual and menial labor involved.                                                                            | Most work involves highly-skilled labor.                                                       |
| Generally robust. E.g. removing a single brick is unlikely to destroy a building.                                     | More fragile than buildings. A single misplaced semicolon can render the whole system useless. |
