<panel header="{{ icon_Q_A }} Coding as a manufacturing activity">
<question has-input="true">

Justify this statement: Coding is still a ‘design’ activity, not a ‘manufacturing’ activity. You may use a comparison (or an analogy) of Software Engineering versus Civil Engineering to argue this point.

<div slot="answer">

Arguments to support this statement:

* If coding is a manufacturing activity, we should be able to do it using robotic machines (just like in the car industry) or low-skilled laborers (like in the construction industry).
* If coding is a manufacturing activity, we wouldn’t be changing it so much after we code software. But if the code is in fact a ‘design’, yes, we would fiddle with it until we get it right.
* Manufacturing is the process of building a finished product based on the design. Code is the design. Manufacturing is what is done by the compiler (fully automated).

However, it is possible for some design work to occur before coding begins. Furthermore, the type of ‘design’ that occurs _during_ coding is at a much lower level than the design that occurs before coding.
