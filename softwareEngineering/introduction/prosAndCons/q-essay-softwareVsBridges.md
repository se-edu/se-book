Comment on this statement: Building software is cheaper and easier than building bridges (all we need is a PC!).

<div slot="answer">

Depends on the size of the software. Manpower required for software is very costly. On the other hand, it may be possible to create very valuable software (e.g. an iPhone application that can generate millions of dollars in revenue) with just a PC and a few days of work!
