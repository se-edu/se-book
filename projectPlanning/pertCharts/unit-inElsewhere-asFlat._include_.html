<p><strong>A PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) chart uses a graphical technique to show the order/sequence of tasks.</strong> It is based on the simple idea of drawing a directed graph in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nodes or vertices capture the effort estimations of tasks, and</li>
<li>Arrows depict the precedence between tasks</li></ul>

<code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>md</code> = man days</p></box>
<p>A PERT chart can help determine the following important information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of tasks. <span class="dimmed">In the example above, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Final Testing</code> cannot begin until all coding of individual subsystems have been completed.</span></li>
<li>Which tasks can be done concurrently. <span class="dimmed">In the example above, the various subsystem designs can start independently once the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>High level design</code> is completed.</span></li>
<li>The shortest possible completion time. <span class="dimmed">In the example above, there is a path (indicated by the shaded boxes) from start to end that determines the shortest possible completion time.</span></li>
<li>The Critical Path. <span class="dimmed">In the example above, the shortest possible path is also the critical path</span>.</li></ul>
<box type="definition" seamless>
<p><strong>Critical path</strong> is the path in which any delay can directly affect the project duration. It is important to ensure tasks on the critical path are completed on time.</p></box></div>
