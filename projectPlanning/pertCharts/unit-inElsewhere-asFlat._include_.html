      <p><strong>PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) chart uses a graphical technique to show the order/sequence of tasks.</strong> It is based on a simple idea of drawing a directed graph in which:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Node or vertex captures the effort estimation of a task, and</li>
        <li>Arrow depicts the precedence between tasks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A PERT chart can help determine the following important information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The order of tasks. <span class="dimmed"> In the example above, <code>Final Testing</code> cannot begin until all coding of individual subsystems have been completed.</span></li>
        <li>Which tasks can be done concurrently. <span class="dimmed"> In the example above, the various subsystem designs can start independently once the <code>High level design</code> is completed.</span></li>
        <li>The shortest possible completion time. <span class="dimmed"> In the example above, there is a path (indicated by the shaded boxes) from start to end that determines the shortest possible completion time.</span></li>
        <li>The Critical Path. <span class="dimmed"> In the example above, the shortest possible path is also the critical path</span>.</li>
      </ul>
      <tip-box type="definition">
        <p><strong>Critical path</strong> is the path in which any delay can directly affect the project duration. It is important to ensure tasks on the critical path are completed on time.</p>
