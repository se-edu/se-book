#### PERT Charts :four:

PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) chart uses a graphical technique to show the order/sequence of tasks. It is based on a simple idea of drawing a directed graph in which:

* Node or vertex captures the effort estimation of a task, and
* Arrow depicts the precedence between tasks

Example: a PERT chart for the Minesweeper project

A PERT chart can help determine the following important information:

*	The order of tasks. For example, observe that the Final Testing phase cannot begin until all coding of individual subsystems have been completed.
*	Tasks can be done concurrently. For example, the various subsystem designs can start independently once the High level design is completed.
*	The shortest possible completion time. From the above PERT chart, there is a path (indicated by the shaded boxes) from start to end that determines the longest possible completion time.
*	The Critical Path. The shortest possible path is also the critical path in it is critical to ensure tasks on this path are completed on time. Any delay would directly affect the delivery time for the project.
