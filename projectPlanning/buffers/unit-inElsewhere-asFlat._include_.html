      <p><strong>A <em>buffer</em> is time set aside to absorb any unforeseen delays.</strong> It is very important to include buffers in a software project schedule because effort/time estimations for software development are notoriously hard. However, <strong>do not inflate task estimates to create hidden buffers</strong>; have explicit buffers instead. <span class="dimmed">Reason: With explicit buffers, it is easier to detect incorrect effort estimates which can serve as feedback to improve future effort estimates.</span></p>
