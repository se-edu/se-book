      <p><strong>A <em>buffer</em> is a time set aside to absorb any unforeseen delays.</strong> It is very important to include buffers in a software project schedule because effort/time estimations for software development is notoriously hard. However,
        <strong>do not inflate task estimates to create hidden buffers</strong>; have explicit buffers instead. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: With explicit buffers it is easier to detect incorrect effort estimates which can serve as a feedback to improve future effort estimates.</span></p>
