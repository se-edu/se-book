<div id="body">

**A _buffer_ is time set aside to absorb any unforeseen delays.** It is very important to include buffers in a software project schedule because effort/time estimations for software development are notoriously hard. However, **do not inflate task estimates to create hidden buffers**; have explicit buffers instead. %%Reason: With explicit buffers, it is easier to detect incorrect effort estimates which can serve as feedback to improve future effort estimates.%%
