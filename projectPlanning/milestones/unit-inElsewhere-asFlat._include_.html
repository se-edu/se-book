<p><strong>A <em>milestone</em> is the end of a stage which indicates significant progress.</strong> You should take into account dependencies and priorities when deciding on the features to be delivered at a certain milestone.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Each intermediate product release is a milestone.</p></box>
<p>In some projects, it is not practical to have a very detailed plan for the whole project due to the uncertainty and unavailability of required information. In such cases, you can use a high-level plan for the whole project and a detailed plan for the next few milestones.</p>
