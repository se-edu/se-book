      <p><strong>A <em>milestone</em> is the end of a stage which indicates a significant progress.</strong> We should take into account dependencies and priorities when deciding on the features to be delivered at a certain milestone.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Each intermediate product release is a milestone.</p>
      </tip-box>
      <p>In some projects, it is not practical to have a very detailed plan for the whole project due to the uncertainty and unavailability of required information. In such cases, we can use a high-level plan for the whole project and a detailed plan for
        the next few milestones.</p>
