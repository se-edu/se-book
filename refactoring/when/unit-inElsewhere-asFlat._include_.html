<p><strong>One way to identify refactoring opportunities is by <em>code smells</em>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>code smell</em> is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.
First, a smell is by definition something that's quick to spot. Second, smells don't always indicate a problem.<br>
--adapted from <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html">https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html</a></p></blockquote>
<p>An example (from the same source as above) is the code smell <em>data class</em> i.e., a class with all data and no behavior. When you encounter the such a class, you can explore if refactoring it to move the corresponding behavior into that class is appropriate. Some more examples:</p>

<p><strong>Periodic refactoring is a good way to pay off the <em>technical debt</em></strong> a code base has accumulated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software systems are prone to the build up of <strong>cruft</strong> - deficiencies in internal quality that make it harder than it would ideally be to modify and extend the system further.Technical Debt is a metaphor, coined by Ward Cunningham, that frames how to think about dealing with this cruft, thinking of it like a financial debt. The extra effort that it takes to add new features is the interest paid on the debt.<br>

<p>While it is important to refactor frequently so as to avoid the accumulation of ‘messy’ code (aka technical debt), an important question is how much refactoring is <em>too much</em> refactoring? <strong>It is too much refactoring when the benefits no longer justify the cost.</strong> The costs and the benefits depend on the context. That is why some refactorings are ‘opposites’ of each other (e.g. <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html"><em>extract method</em></a> vs <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/inlineMethod.html"><em>inline method</em></a>).</p></div>
