    <p>Whether a refactoring improves the code or degrades it depends on the situation. That is why some refactorings are ‘opposites’ of each other (e.g. <em>extract method vs inline method</em>).</p>
    <p>It is important to refactor frequently so as to avoid the accumulation of ‘messy’ code which might get out of control.</p>
    <p>How much refactoring is too much refactoring? It is too much refactoring when the benefits no longer justify the cost. The costs and the benefits depend on the context.</p>

                <p>Explanation: Yes they are. Mentioned in the handout. Please refer to the handout to find why such opposites exist among recommended refactorings.</p>
