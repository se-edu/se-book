**A use case can ==include== another use case.** !!Underlined text!! is used to show an inclusion of a use case.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} This use case includes two other use cases, one in step 1 and one in step 2.

<div class="text-monospace">

* Software System: LearnSys
* Use case:  UC01 - Conduct Survey
* Actors: Staff, Student
* MSS:
  1. Staff ==!!creates the survey (UC44)!!==.
  1. Student ==!!completes the survey (UC50)!!==.
  1. Staff views the survey results.<br>
     Use case ends.
</div>
</box>

Inclusions are useful,
* when you don't want to clutter a use case with too many low-level steps.
* when a set of steps is repeated in multiple use cases.

You use a dotted arrow and an `<<include>>` annotation to show use case inclusions in a use case diagram. Note how the arrow direction is different from the `<<extend>>` arrows.
