<p>A use case is an interaction between a system and its <em>actors</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Actors in Use Cases</strong></p>
<box type="definition" seamless>
<div><p><strong>Actor</strong>: An actor (in a use case) is a role played by a user.  An actor can be a human or another system. Actors are not part of the system; they reside outside the system.</p></div></box>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Some example actors for a Learning Management System:</p>
<div class="text-monospace">
<ul>
<li>Actors: Guest, Student, Staff, Admin, <tooltip><template #content>an exam management system</template>ExamSys</tooltip>, <tooltip><template #content>a library management system</template>LibSys</tooltip>.</li></ul></div></box>
<p><strong>A use case can involve multiple actors.</strong></p>
<box>
<div class="text-monospace">
<ul>
<li>Software System: LearnSys</li>
<li>Use case: UC01 Conduct Survey</li>
<li>Actors: <mark>Staff, Student</mark></li></ul></div></box>
<p><strong>An actor can be involved in many use cases.</strong></p>
<box>
<div class="text-monospace">
<ul>
<li>Software System: LearnSys</li>
<li>Actor: Staff</li>
<li>Use cases: <mark>UC01 Conduct Survey, UC02 Set Up Course Schedule, UC03 Email Class, ...</mark></li></ul></div></box>
<p><strong>A single person/system can play many roles.</strong></p>
<box>
<div class="text-monospace">
<ul>
<li>Software System: LearnSys</li>
<li>Person: <mark>a student</mark></li>
<li>Actors (or Roles): Student, Guest, Tutor</li></ul></div></box>
<p><strong>Many persons/systems can play a single role.</strong></p>
<box>
<div class="text-monospace">
<ul>
<li>Software System: LearnSys</li>
<li>Actor (or role): Student</li>
<li>Persons that can play this role: <mark>undergraduate student, graduate student, a staff member doing a part-time course, exchange student</mark></li></ul></div></box>

<p><strong>Use cases can be specified at <em>various levels of detail</em>.</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Consider the three use cases given below. Clearly, (a) is at a higher level than (b) and (b) is at a higher level than (c).</p>
<div class="text-monospace">
<ul>
<li>System: LearnSys</li>
<li>Use cases:<br>
a. Conduct a survey<br>
b. Take the survey<br>
c. Answer survey question</li></ul></div></box>
<p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success text-white"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> While modeling user-system interactions,</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with high level use cases and progressively work toward lower level use cases.</li>
<li>Be mindful of which level of detail you are working at and not to mix use cases of different levels.</li></ul></div>

<question has-input="false">
<p>Consider a simple movie ticket vending machine application. Every week, the theatre staff will enter the weekly schedule as well as ticket price for each show.  A customer sees the schedule and the ticket price displayed at the machine. There is a slot to insert money, a keypad to enter a code for a movie, a code for the show time, and the number of tickets.  A display shows the customer's balance inside the machine.  A customer may choose to cancel a transaction before pressing the “buy” button. Printed tickets can be collected from a slot at the bottom of the machine.  The machine also displays messages such as &quot;Please enter more money”, “Request fewer tickets&quot; or &quot;SOLD OUT!”.  Finally, a &quot;Return Change&quot; button allows the customer to get back his unspent money.</p>
<p><strong>Draw a use case diagram for the above requirements.</strong></p>

<question has-input="false">
<p>A software house wishes to automate its Quality Assurance division.</p>
<p>The system is to be used by Testers, Programmers and System Administrators. Only an administrator can create new users and assign tasks to programmers. Any tester can create a bug report, as well as set the status of a bug report as ‘closed’. Only a programmer can set the state of a bug report to ‘fixed’, but a programmer cannot set the status of a bug report to ‘closed’. Each tester is assigned just one task at a time. A task involves testing of a particular component for a particular customer. Tester must document the bugs they find. Each bug is given a unique identifier. Other information recorded about the bug is component id, severity, date and time reported, programmer who is assigned to fix it, date fixed, date retested and date closed. The system keeps track of which bugs are assigned to which programmer at any given time. It should be able to generate reports on the number of bugs found, fixed and closed e.g. number of bugs per component and per customer; number of bugs found by a particular tester; number of bugs awaiting to be fixed; number of bugs awaiting to be retested; number of bugs awaiting to be assigned to programmers etc.</p>
<p><strong>Develop a use case diagram to capture their requirements given below.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The given description contains information not relevant to use case modeling. Furthermore, the description is not enough to complete the use case diagram. All these are realities of real projects. However, the process of trying to create this use case diagram prompts us to investigate issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is ‘edit bug report’ a use case or is editing the bug report covered by other use cases such as those for setting the status of bug reports? If it is indeed a separate use case, who are the actors of that use case?</li>
<li>Does ‘assign task’ simply mean ‘assign bug report’ or are there other types of tasks?</li>
<li>There was some mention about Customers and Components. Does the system have to support use cases for creating and maintaining details about those entities? For example, should we have a ‘create customer record’ use case?</li>
<li>Which actors can perform the ‘generate report’ use case? Are reports generated automatically by the system at a specific time or generated ‘on demand’ when users request to view them? Do we have to treat different types of reports as different use cases (in case some types of reports are restricted to some types of users)? The above diagram assumes (just for illustration) that the report is generated on demand and only the system admin can generate any report.</li></ul></div></template></question></panel></div></panel></div></div></div></div>
