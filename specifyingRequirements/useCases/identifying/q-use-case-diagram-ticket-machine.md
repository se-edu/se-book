<question has-input="false">

Consider a simple movie ticket vending machine application. Every week, the theatre staff will enter the weekly schedule as well as ticket price for each show.  A customer sees the schedule and the ticket price displayed at the machine. There is a slot to insert money, a keypad to enter a code for a movie, a code for the show time, and the number of tickets.  A display shows the customer's balance inside the machine.  A customer may choose to cancel a transaction before pressing the “buy” button. Printed tickets can be collected from a slot at the bottom of the machine.  The machine also displays messages such as "Please enter more money”, “Request fewer tickets" or "SOLD OUT!”.  Finally, a "Return Change" button allows the customer to get back his unspent money.

**Draw a use case diagram for the above requirements.**

Note that most of the details in the description are better given as part of the use case description rather than as low-level use cases in the diagram.
