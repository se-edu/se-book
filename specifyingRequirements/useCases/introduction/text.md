**<trigger for="modal:uml" trigger="click">UML</trigger> includes a diagram type called use case diagrams that can illustrate use cases of a system visually**, providing a visual ‘table of contents’ of the use cases of a system.

In the example on the right, note how use cases are shown as ovals and user roles relevant to each use case are shown as stick figures connected to the corresponding ovals.
