          <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br>
                Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
              <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong>
                Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
              <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br>
                Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br>
                For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>
                When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br>
                When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br>
                When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
        </div>
        <p>While use cases can be recorded on <tooltip content="e.g. index cards or sticky notes">physical paper</tooltip> in the initial stages, an online tool is more suitable for longer-term management of user stories, especially if the team is not <tooltip content="physically in the same location">co-located</tooltip>.</p>

            <p><em>Extreme programming (XP)</em> is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent &quot;releases&quot; in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.

          uses User stories to capture requirements.
          <p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/userstories.html">This page</a> in their website explains the difference between user stories and traditional requirements.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>
