<p>[User stories] strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them. In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written. <sub>[Mike Cohn, MountainGoat Software <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories">ðŸ”—</a>]</sub></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>User stories differ from <popover><template #content>e.g. a description of the requirements written in prose</template>traditional requirements specifications</popover> mainly in the level of detail.</strong> User stories should only provide enough details to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the user story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the user story, the developers will meet with the customer face-to-face  to work out a more detailed description of the requirements. <span class="dimmed">[<trigger for="modal:xp-user-stories" trigger="click">more...</trigger>]</span></p>
<p><strong>User stories can capture <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:userStoriesUsage-nfr">non-functional requirements</trigger> too</strong> because even NFRs must benefit some stakeholder.</p>

<p>Requirements can be divided into two in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Functional requirements</em> specify what the system should do.</strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Non-functional requirements</em> specify the constraints under which the system is developed and operated.</strong></li></ol>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Some examples of non-functional requirement categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data requirements e.g. size, <tooltip><template #content>how often do data change</template>volatility</tooltip>, <tooltip><template #content>saving data permanently</template>persistency</tooltip> etc.,</li>
<li>Environment requirements e.g. technical environment in which the system would operate in or needs to be compatible with.</li>
<li>Accessibility, Capacity, Compliance with regulations, Documentation, Disaster recovery, Efficiency, Extensibility, Fault tolerance, Interoperability, Maintainability, Privacy, Portability, Quality, Reliability, Response time, Robustness, Scalability, Security, Stability, Testability, and more ...</li></ul>
<panel type="seamless" expanded><template #header><p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Some concrete examples of NFRs</p></template>
<ul>
<li>Business/domain rules:   e.g. the size of the minefield cannot be smaller than five.</li>
<li>Constraints: e.g.  the system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system; system testers are available only during the last month of the project; the total project cost should not exceed $1.5 million.</li>
<li>Technical requirements: e.g. the system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</li>
<li>Performance requirements: e.g. the system should respond within two seconds.</li>
<li>Quality requirements: e.g. the system should be usable by a novice who has never carried out an online purchase.</li>
<li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>
<li>Notes about project scope: e.g. the product is not required to handle the printing of reports.</li>
<li>Any other noteworthy points: e.g. the game should not use images deemed offensive to those injured in real mine clearing activities.</li></ul></panel></box>
<p>You may have to spend an extra effort in digging NFRs out as early as possible because,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>NFRs are easier to miss</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., stakeholders tend to think of functional requirements first</span></li>
<li>sometimes <strong>NFRs are critical to the success of the software.</strong> <span class="dimmed">E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low security is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionality.</span></li></ol></div>

<question>
<p>Given below are some requirements of TEAMMATES (an online peer evaluation system for education). Which one of these are non-functional requirements?</p>
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> a. The response to any use action should become visible within 5 seconds.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> b. The application admin should be able to view a log of user activities.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> c. The source code should be open source.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> d. A course should be able to have up to 2000 students.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> e. As a student user, I can view details of my team members so that I can know who they are.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled"><input class="task-list-item-checkbox" type="checkbox"> f. The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are not IT-savvy.</li>

<template #answer><div>
<p>(a)(c)(d)(f)(g)</p>
<p>Explanation: (b) are (e) are functions available for a specific user types. Therefore, they are functional requirements. (a), (c), (d), (f) and (g) are either constraints on functionality or constraints on how the project is done, both of which are considered non-functional requirements.</p></div></template></question></panel></div></panel></div></div></div></div></div></modal>

<p>Given below is a possible <em>recipe</em> you can take when using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Step 0:</strong></strong> <strong>Clear your mind of preconceived product ideas</strong></p>
<p>Even if you already have some idea of what your product will look/behave like in the end, clear your mind of those ideas. The product is the <em>solution</em>. At this point, we are still at the stage of figuring out the <em>problem</em> (i.e., user requirements). Let's try to get from the problem to the solution in a systematic way, one step at a time.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> <strong>Define the <em>target user</em> as a <em>persona</em>:</strong></p>
<p>Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, salesperson) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even narrow it down to a <em>persona</em>. Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> <strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong></p>
<p>Decide the exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. It is also useful to specify what related problems it will <em>not</em> solve so that the exact scope is clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ProductX helps Jean keep track of all her school contacts. It does not cover communicating with contacts.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> <strong>List <em>scenarios</em> to form a <em>narrative</em>:</strong></p>
<p>Think of the various scenarios your target user is likely to go through as she uses your app. Following a chronological sequence as if you are telling a story might be helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. First use:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Jean gets to know about ProductX. She downloads it and launches it to check out what it can do.</li>
<li>After playing around with the product for a bit, Jean wants to start using it for real.</li>
<li>...</li></ol>
<p><strong>B. Second use:</strong> (Jean is still a beginner)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jean launches ProductX. She wants to find ...</li>
<li>...</li></ol>
<p><strong>C. 10th use:</strong> (Jean is a little bit familiar with the app)</p>
<ol>
<li>...</li></ol>
<p><strong>D. 100th use:</strong> (Jean is an expert user)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jean launches the app and does ... and ... followed by ... as per her usual habit.</li>
<li>Jean feels some of the data in the app are no longer needed. She wants to get rid of them to reduce clutter.</li>
<li></li></ol></blockquote>
<p>More examples that might apply to some products:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jean uses the app at the start of the day to ...</li>
<li>Jean uses the app before going to sleep to ...</li>
<li>Jean hasn't used the app for a while because she was on a three-month training programme. She is now back at work and wants to resume her daily use of the app.</li>
<li>Jean moves to another company. Some of her clients come with her but some don't.</li>
<li>Jean starts freelancing in her spare time. She wants to keep her freelancing clients separate from her other clients.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> <strong>List the user stories to support the scenarios:</strong></p>
<p>Based on the scenarios, decide on the user stories you need to support. For example, based on the scenario 'A. First use', you might have user stories such as these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As a potential user exploring the app, I can see the app populated with sample data, so that I can easily see how the app will look like when it is in use.</li>
<li>As a user ready to start using the app, I can purge all current data, so that I can get rid of sample/experimental data I used for exploring the app.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>To give another example, based on the scenario 'D. 100th use', you might have user stories such as these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As an expert user, I can create shortcuts for tasks, so that I can save time on frequently performed tasks.</li>
<li>As a long-time user, I can archive/hide unused data, so that I am not distracted by irrelevant data.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p><mark>Do not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while brainstorming</mark>. <span class="dimmed">Reason: an important aspect of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>Other tips:</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br>
Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
<li><strong>Don't go into too much detail:</strong>
For example, consider this user story: <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that need my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>
When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered 'needs my attention most at the present time'. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br>
When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like. That is, don't try to reverse-engineer a preconceived product idea into user stories.</li>
<li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br>
When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li></ul></box></div>
<p>While use cases can be recorded on <tooltip><template #content>e.g. index cards or sticky notes</template>physical paper</tooltip> in the initial stages, an online tool is more suitable for longer-term management of user stories, especially if the team is not <tooltip><template #content>physically in the same location</template>co-located</tooltip>.</p>

  <tab><template #header>GitHub Project Boards</template>
<p>You can create issues for each of the user stories and use a GitHub <em>Project Board</em> to sort them into categories.</p>

<div id="user-stories-in-issue-tracker">
<p>You can break the user story into issue subject and description in this way:</p>
<div class="table-responsive"><table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped"><thead>
<tr>
<th>title</th>
<th><code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>As a user I can add a deadline</code></th></tr></thead>

<p>Alternatively, you can put the entire user story in the description.</p>
<div class="table-responsive"><table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped"><thead>
<tr>
<th>title</th>
<th><code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Add deadline</code></th></tr></thead>

<em>Extreme programming (XP)</em> is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent &quot;releases&quot; in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.

<p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail.
