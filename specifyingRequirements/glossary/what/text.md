{{ icon_example }} Here is a partial glossary from a variant of the _Snakes and Ladders_ game:

* Conditional square: A square that specifies a specific face value which a player has to throw before his/her piece can leave the square.
* Normal square: a normal square does not have any conditions, snakes, or ladders in it.

</box>

Specifying a term in the glossary is useful in the following cases:

* A domain-specific/technical term that may not be known to all stakeholders, to indicate its definition
* When a term has multiple meanings, to indicate which of them is used in the project
* When there are multiple terms used for the same concept, to indicate which of them will be used in the project
