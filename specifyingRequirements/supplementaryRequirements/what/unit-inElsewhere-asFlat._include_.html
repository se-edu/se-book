                      <li>Constraints: e.g. the system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system; system testers are available only during the last month of the project; the total project cost should not exceed $1.5

                      <li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>

                <p>We may have to spend an extra effort in digging NFRs out as early as possible because,</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>NFRs are easier to miss</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., stakeholders tend to think of functional requirements first</span></li>
                  <li>sometimes <strong>NFRs are critical to the success of the software.</strong> <span class="dimmed"> E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low security is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionality.</span></li>

                          <p>Given below are some requirements of TEAMMATES (an online peer evaluation system for education). Which one of these are non-functional requirements?</p>

                            <p>Explanation: (b) are (e) are functions available for a specific user types. Therefore, they are functional requirements. (a), (c), (d), (f) and (g) are either constraints on functionality or constraints on how the project is
                              done, both of which are considered non-functional requirements.</p>
