<question>
Choose the incorrect statement.

- ( ) a. An object diagrams models the structure of an OO system at a given time.
- ( ) b. A class diagrams models the general structure of an OO solution.
- ( ) c. A class diagram can correspond to many object diagrams.
- ( ) d. A sequence diagram represents how objects are connected to each other.
- ( ) e. Sequence diagrams can be used to find APIs for classes.

<div slot="answer">

- (x) d. A sequence diagram represents how objects are connected to each other.

Explanation: A sequence diagram is a behavior diagram, not a structure diagram. An SD can represent how objects interact with each other (i.e., behavior), not how they are connected to each other (i.e. structure).
