      <p><strong>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over the network</strong>, rather than a product running on a local machine. This means the actual hardware and software is located at a remote location, typically, at a large server
        farm, while users access them over the network. Maintenance of the hardware and software is managed by the cloud provider while users typically pay for only the amount of services they use. This model is similar to the consumption of electricity;
        the power company manages the power plant, while the consumers pay them only for the electricity used. The cloud computing model optimizes hardware and software utilization and reduces the cost to consumers. Furthermore, users can scale up/down
        their utilization at will without having to upgrade their hardware and software. The traditional non-cloud model of computing is similar to everyone buying their own generators to create electricity for their own use.</p>
