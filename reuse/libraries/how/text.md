These are the typical steps required to use a library.

1. Read the documentation to confirm that its functionality fits your needs
2. Check the license to confirm that it allows reuse in the way you plan to reuse it. For example, some libraries might allow non-commercial use only.
3. Download the library and make it accessible to your project. Alternatively, you can configure your <tooltip content="e.g. _Gradle_ (for Java) and _Pipenv_ (for Python)">dependency management tool</tooltip> to do it for you.
4. Call the library API from your code where you need to use the library functionality.
