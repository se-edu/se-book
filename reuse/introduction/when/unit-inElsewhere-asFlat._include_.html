<p>While you may be tempted to use many libraries/frameworks/platforms that seem to crop up on a regular basis and promise to bring great benefits, note that <strong>there are costs associated with reuse</strong>. Here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reused code <strong>may be an overkill</strong> (think <em>using a sledgehammer to crack a nut</em>), increasing the size of, and/or degrading the performance of, your software.</li>
<li>The reused software <strong>may not be mature/stable enough</strong> to be used in an important product. That means the software can change drastically and rapidly, possibly in ways that break your software.</li>
<li>Non-mature software has the <strong>risk of dying off</strong> as fast as they emerged, leaving you with a dependency that is no longer maintained.</li>
<li>The license of the reused software (or its dependencies) <strong>restrict how you can use/develop your software</strong>.</li>
<li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product, but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as fast as you need them to.</li>
<li><strong>Malicious code can sneak into your product</strong> via compromised dependencies.</li></ul></div>

<question has-input="true">
<p>One of your teammates is proposing to use a recently-released “cool” UI framework for your class project. List the pros and cons of this idea.</p>
<template #answer><div>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>The potential to create a much better product by reusing the framework.</li>
<li>Learning a new framework is good for future job prospects.</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning curve may be steep.</li>
<li>May not be stable (as it was recently released).</li>
<li>May not allow you to do exactly what you want. While frameworks allow customization, such customization can be limited.</li>
<li>Performance penalties.</li>
<li>Might interfere with the learning objectives of the course.</li></ul>
<p>Note that having more cons does not mean you should not use this framework. Further investigation is required before you can make a final decision.</p></div></template></question></panel></div></panel></div></div></div></div>
