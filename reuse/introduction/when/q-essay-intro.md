<panel header="{{ icon_Q_A }} Using a cool UI framework">
<question has-input="true">

One of your teammates is proposing to use a recently-released “cool” UI framework for your class project. List the pros and cons of this idea.

<div slot="answer">

Pros

* The potential to create a much better product by reusing the framework.
* Learning a new framework is good for future job prospects.

Cons

* Learning curve may be steep.
* May not be stable (as it was recently released).
* May not allow you to do exactly what you want. While frameworks allow customization, such customization can be limited.
* Performance penalties.
* Might interfere with the learning objectives of the module.

Note that having more cons does not mean you should not use this framework. Further investigation is required before you can make a final decision.
