<p><strong>A <em>platform</em> provides a runtime environment for applications.</strong> A platform is often bundled with various libraries, tools, frameworks, and technologies in addition to a runtime environment but the defining characteristic of a software platform is the presence of a runtime environment.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Technically, an operating system can be called a platform. For example, Windows PC is a platform for desktop applications while iOS is a platform for mobile applications.</p></box>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> <strong>Two well-known examples of platforms are JavaEE and .NET</strong>, both of which sit above the operating systems layer, and are used to develop <trigger for="modal:enterprise-application" trigger="click">enterprise applications</trigger>. Infrastructure services such as connection pooling, load balancing, remote code execution, transaction management, authentication, security, messaging etc. are done similarly in most enterprise applications. Both JavaEE and .NET provide these services to applications in a customizable way without developers having to implement them from scratch every time.</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition) is both a framework and a platform for writing enterprise applications. The runtime used by JavaEE applications is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that can run on different Operating Systems.</li>
<li>.NET is a similar platform and framework. Its runtime is called CLR (Common Language Runtime) and it is usually used on Windows machines.</li></ul></box>

<p><strong>Enterprise application</strong>: ‘enterprise applications’ refer to software applications used by organizations and therefore have to meet much higher demands (such as in scalability, security, performance, and robustness) than software meant for individual use.</p></div></modal></div>
