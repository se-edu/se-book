**The overall structure and execution flow of a specific category of software systems can be very similar. The similarity is an opportunity to reuse at a high scale.**

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Running example:

IDEs for different programming languages are similar in how they support editing code, organizing project files, debugging, etc.

</box>

**A _software framework_ is a reusable implementation of a software (or part thereof) providing _generic_ functionality that can be selectively customized to produce a _specific_ application.**

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Running example:

Eclipse is an IDE framework that can be used to create IDEs for different programming languages.

</box>

**Some frameworks provide a complete implementation of a _default_ behavior which makes them immediately usable.**

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Running example:

Eclipse is a fully functional Java IDE out-of-the-box.

</box>

**A framework facilitates the adaptation and customization of some desired functionality.**

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Running example:

The Eclipse plugin system can be used to create an IDE for different programming languages while reusing most of the existing IDE features of Eclipse.

e.g., https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pydev-python-ide-eclipse

</box>

Some frameworks cover only a specific component or an aspect.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} JavaFX is a framework for creating Java GUIs. Tkinter is a GUI framework for Python.

</box>

<box>

{{ icon_example }} More examples of frameworks

* Frameworks for web-based applications: Drupal (PHP), Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Spring (Java)
* Frameworks for testing: JUnit (Java), unittest (Python), Jest (JavaScript)
