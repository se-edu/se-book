#### What :two:

The overall structure and execution flow of a specific category of software systems can be very similar. The similarity is an opportunity to reuse at a high scale.

<tip-box>

Running example:

IDEs for different programming languages are similar in how they support editing code, organizing project files, debugging, etc.

</tip-box>

A _software framework_ is a reusable implementation of a software (or part thereof) providing _generic_ functionality that can be selectively customized to produce a _specific_ application.

<tip-box>

Running example:

Eclipse is an IDE framework that can be used to create IDEs for different programming languages.

</tip-box>

Some frameworks provide a complete implementation of a _default_ behavior which makes them immediately usable.

<tip-box>

Running example:

Eclipse is a fully functional Java IDE out-of-the-box.

</tip-box>

A framework facilitates the adaptation and customization of some desired functionality.

<tip-box>

Running example:

Eclipse plugin system can be used to create an IDE for different programming languages while reusing most of the existing IDE features of Eclipse. E.g. https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pydev-python-ide-eclipse

</tip-box>

Some frameworks cover only a specific components or an aspect.

<tip-box>

Example:

JavaFx a framework for creating Java GUIs.

</tip-box>

<tip-box>

More examples:

*	Drupal: a framework for Web-based applications, content management systems in particular. Implemented using PHP
*	Ruby on Rails : another Web-application framework similar to Drupal but uses Ruby instead of PHP
*	JUnit: a framework for testing Java code.
