**Context**

Components need to access functionality deep inside other components.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} The `UI` component of a `Library` system might want to access functionality of the `Book` class contained inside the `Logic` component.

<pic src="{{baseUrl}}/designPatterns/facade/what/images/textBook.png" height="120" />
<p/>

</box>

**Problem**

Access to the component should be allowed without exposing its internal details. %%e.g.  the `UI` component should access the functionality of the `Logic` component without knowing that it contains a `Book` class within it.%%

**Solution**

Include a <tooltip content="a French word that means 'front of a building'">Fa√ßade</tooltip> class that sits between the component internals and users of the component such that all access to the component happens through the Facade class.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} The following class diagram applies the Facade pattern to the `Library System` example. The `LibraryLogic` class is the Facade class.
