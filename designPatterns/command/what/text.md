<div id="body">

**Context**

A system is required to execute a number of commands, each doing a different task. For example, a system might have to support `Sort`, `List`, `Reset` commands.

**Problem**

It is preferable that some part of the code executes these commands without having to know each command type. %%e.g., there can be a `CommandQueue` object that is responsible for queuing commands and executing them without knowledge of what each command does.%%

**Solution**

The essential element of this pattern is to have a general `<<Command>>` object that can be passed around, stored, executed, etc without knowing the type of command (i.e. via polymorphism).

Let us examine an example application of the pattern first:

<box>

{{ icon_example }} In the example solution below, the `CommandCreator` creates `List`, `Sort`, and `Reset Command` objects and adds them to the `CommandQueue` object. The `CommandQueue` object treats them all as `Command` objects and performs the execute/undo operation on each of them without knowledge of the specific `Command` type. When executed, each `Command` object will access the `DataStore` object to carry out its task. The `Command` class can also be an abstract class or an interface.

</box>

The general form of the solution is as follows.

<pic src="{{baseUrl}}/designPatterns/command/what/images/clientInvoker.png" height="200" />
<p/>

The `<<Client>>` creates a `<<ConcreteCommand>>` object, and passes it to the `<<Invoker>>`. The `<<Invoker>>` object treats all commands as a general `<<Command>>` type.  `<<Invoker>>` issues a request by calling `execute()` on the command. If a command is undoable, `<<ConcreteCommand>>` will store the state for undoing the command prior to invoking `execute()`.  In addition, the `<<ConcreteCommand>>` object may have to be linked to any `<<Receiver>>` of the command (<tooltip content="the object the command will operate on, in case different commands operate on different objects">?</tooltip>) before it is passed to the `<<Invoker>>`. Note that an application of the command pattern does not have to follow the structure given above.
