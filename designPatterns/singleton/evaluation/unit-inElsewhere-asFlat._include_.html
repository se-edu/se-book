<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>easy to apply</li>
<li>effective in achieving its goal with minimal extra work</li>
<li>provides an easy way to access the singleton object from anywhere in the codebase</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The singleton object acts like a global variable that increases coupling across the codebase.</li>
<li>In testing, it is difficult to replace Singleton objects with stubs (static methods cannot be overridden).</li>
<li>In testing, singleton objects carry data from one test to another even when you want each test to be independent of the others.</li></ul>
<p>Given that there are some significant cons, it is recommended that you apply the Singleton pattern when, in addition to requiring only one instance of a class, there is a risk of creating multiple objects by mistake, and creating such multiple objects has real negative consequences.</p></div>
