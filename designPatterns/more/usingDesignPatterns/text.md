{patterns provide a vocabulary}

The more patterns one acquires, the more ‘experienced’ she is. Exposing oneself to a multitude of patterns (at least the context and problem) is a must. Some patterns are domain-specific (e.g. patterns for distributed applications), some are created in-house (e.g. patterns in the company/project) and some can be self-created (e.g. from past experience).

When using patterns, be careful not to overuse them. Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they are needed. Before applying a pattern, make sure that:

*	there is substantial improvement in  the design, not just superficial.
*	the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).
