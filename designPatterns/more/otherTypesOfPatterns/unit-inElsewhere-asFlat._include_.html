      <p>The notion of capturing design ideas as &quot;patterns&quot; is usually attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>. He is a building architect noted for his theories about design. His book
        <em>Timeless way of building</em> talks about &quot;design patterns&quot; for constructing buildings.</p>
      <p>Here is a sample pattern from that book:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>When a room has a window with a view, the window becomes a focal point: people are attracted to the window and want to look through it. The furniture in the room creates a second focal point: everyone is attracted toward whatever point the furniture
          aims them at (usually the center of the room or a TV). This makes people feel uncomfortable. They want to look out the window, and toward the other focus at the same time. If you rearrange the furniture, so that its focal point becomes the window,
          then everyone will suddenly notice that the room is much more “comfortable”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Apparently, patterns and anti-patterns are found in the field of building architecture. This is because they are general concepts applicable to any domain, not just software design. In software engineering, there are many general types of patterns:
        Analysis patterns, Design patterns, Testing patterns, Architectural patterns, Project management patterns, and so on.</p>
      <p>In fact, the abstraction occurrence pattern is more of an analysis pattern than a design pattern, while MVC is more of an architectural pattern.</p>
      <p>New patterns can be created too. If a common problem needs to be solved frequently that leads to a non-obvious and better solution, it can be formulated as a pattern so that it can be reused by others. However, don’t reinvent the wheel; the pattern
        might already exist.</p>

                <p>Here are some common elements of a design pattern: Name, Context, Problem, Solution, Anti-patterns (optional), Consequences (optional), other useful information (optional).</p>
                <p>Using similar elements, describe a pattern that is not a design pattern. It must be a pattern you have noticed, not a pattern already documented by others. You may also give a pattern not related to software.</p>
                <p>Some examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A pattern for testing textual UIs.</li>
                  <li>A pattern for striking a good bargain at a mall such as Sim-Lim Square.</li>
