      <p><strong>The most famous source of design patterns is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">&quot;Gang of Four&quot; (GoF) book</a> which contains 23 design patterns divided into three categories</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creational</strong>: About object creation. They separate the operation of an application from how its objects are created.
          <ul>
            <li>Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, Singleton</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Structural</strong>: About the composition of objects into larger structures while catering for future extension in structure.
          <ul>
            <li>Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Façade, Flyweight, Proxy</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral</strong>: Defining how objects interact and how responsibility is distributed among them.
          <ul>
            <li>Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Template Method, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor</li>
          </ul>
