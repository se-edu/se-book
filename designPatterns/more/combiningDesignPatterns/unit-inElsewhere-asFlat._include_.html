<p><strong>Design patterns are usually embedded in a larger design and sometimes applied in combination with other design patterns.</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Let us look at a case study that shows how design patterns are used in the design of a class structure for a Stock Inventory System (SIS) for a shop. The shop sells appliances and accessories for the appliances. SIS simply stores information about each item in the store.</p>
<p><strong>Use Cases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new item</li>
<li>View information about an item</li>
<li>Modify information about an item</li>
<li>View all available accessories for a given appliance</li>
<li>List all items in the store</li></ul>
<p>SIS can be accessed using multiple terminals. Shop assistants use their own terminals to access SIS, while the shop manager’s terminal continuously displays a list of all items in the store. In the future, it is expected that suppliers of items use their own applications to connect to SIS to get real-time information about the current stock status. User authentication is not required for the current version, but may be required in the future.</p>
<p>A step by step explanation of the design is given below. Note that this is one out of many possible designs. Design patterns are also applied where appropriate.</p>
<p>A <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>StockItem</code> can be an Appliance or an Accessory.</p>

<p></p>
<p>To track that each <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Accessory</code> is associated with the correct <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Appliance</code>, consider the following alternative class structures.</p>
<pic src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeOne.png" height="120"></pic>
<p></p>
<p>The third one seems more appropriate (the second one is suitable if accessories can have accessories). Next, consider between keeping a list of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Appliances</code>, and a list of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>StockItems</code>.  Which is more appropriate?</p>

<p></p>
<p>The latter seems more suitable because it can handle both appliances and accessories the same way. Next, an abstraction occurrence pattern is applied to keep track of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>StockItems</code>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Note the inclusion of navigabilities. Here’s a sample object diagram based on the class model created thus far.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Next, apply the façade pattern to shield the SIS internals from the UI.</p>

<p></p>
<p>As UI consists of multiple views, the  MVC pattern is applied here.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Some views need to be updated when the data changes; apply the Observer pattern here.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In addition, the Singleton pattern can be applied to the façade class.</p></box></div>
