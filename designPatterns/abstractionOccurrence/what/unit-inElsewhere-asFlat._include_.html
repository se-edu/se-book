<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>There is a group of similar entities that appear to be ‘occurrences’ (or ‘copies’) of the same thing, sharing lots of common information, but also differing in significant ways.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> In a library, there can be multiple copies of the same book title. Each copy shares common information such as book title, author, ISBN, etc. However, there are also significant differences like purchase date and barcode number (assumed to be unique for each copy of the book).</p>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Episodes of the same TV series</li>
<li>Stock items of the same product model (e.g. TV sets of the same model)</li></ul></box>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>Representing the objects mentioned previously as a single class would be problematic because it results in duplication of data which can lead to inconsistencies in data (if some of the duplicates are not updated consistently).</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Take for example the problem of representing books in a library. Assume that there could be multiple copies of the same title, bearing the same ISBN number, but different serial numbers.</p>
<pic src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/book.png" height="200"></pic>
<p></p>
<p>The above solution requires common information to be duplicated by all instances. This will not only waste storage space, but also creates a consistency problem. Suppose that after creating several copies of the same title, the librarian realized that the author name was wrongly spelt. To correct this mistake, the system needs to go through every copy of the same title to make the correction. Also, if a new copy of the title is added later on, the librarian (or the system) has to make sure that all information entered is the same as the existing copies to avoid inconsistency.</p></box>
<p><strong>Anti-pattern</strong></p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Refer to the same Library example given above.</p>
<pic src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookFriends.png" height="240"></pic>
<p></p>
<p>The design above segregates the common and unique information into a class hierarchy. Each book title is represented by a separate class with common data (i.e. Name, Author, ISBN) hard-coded in the class itself. This solution is problematic because each book title is represented as a class, resulting in thousands of classes (one for each title). Every time the library buys new books, the source code of the system will have to be updated with new classes.</p></box>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Let a copy of an entity (e.g. a copy of a book) be represented by two objects instead of one, separating the common and unique information into two classes to avoid duplication.</p>
<box>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Given below is how the pattern is applied to the Library example:</p>
<pic src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookTitleBookCopy.png" height="260"></pic>
<p></p>
<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Here's a more generic example:</p>
<pic src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/beforeAfter.png" height="370"></pic>
<p></p></box>
<p>The general solution:</p>
<pic src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/abstractionOccurrence.png" height="40"></pic>
<p></p>
<p>The <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>&lt;&lt;Abstraction&gt;&gt;</code> class should hold all common information, and the unique information should be kept by the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>&lt;&lt;Occurrence&gt;&gt;</code> class. Note that ‘Abstraction’ and ‘Occurrence’ are not class names, but roles played by each class. Think of this diagram as a <em>meta-model</em> (i.e. a ‘model of a model’) of the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>BookTitle-BookCopy</code> class diagram given above.</p></div>

<p>Which pairs of classes are likely to be the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>&lt;&lt;Abstraction&gt;&gt;</code> and the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>&lt;&lt;Occurrence&gt;&gt;</code> of the abstraction occurrence pattern?</p>

<li>Car, Wheel</li>

<template #answer><div>
<p>One of the key things to keep in mind is that the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>&lt;&lt;Abstraction&gt;&gt;</code> does not represent a real entity. Rather, it represents some information common to a set of objects. A single real entity is represented by an object of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>&lt;&lt;Abstraction&gt;&gt;</code> type and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>&lt;&lt;Occurrence&gt;&gt;</code> type.</p>
<p>Before applying the pattern, some attributes have the same values for multiple objects. For example, w.r.t. the BookTitle-BookCopy example given in this handout, values of attributes such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>bookTitle</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>ISBN</code> are exactly the same for copies of the same book.</p>
<p>After applying the pattern, the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Abstraction</code> and the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Occurrence</code> classes together represent one entity. It is as if one class has been split into two. For example, a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>BookTitle</code> object and a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>BookCopy</code> object combine to represent an actual <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Book</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>CarModel, Car: <strong>Yes</strong></li>
<li>Car, Wheel: <strong>No. Wheel is a ‘part of’ Car. A wheel is not an occurrence of Car.</strong></li>
<li>Club, Member: <strong>No. This is a ‘part of’ relationship.</strong></li>
<li>TeamLeader, TeamMember: <strong>No. A TeamMember is not an occurrence of a TeamLeader or vice versa.</strong></li>
<li>Magazine, MagazineIssue: <strong>Yes.</strong></li></ol></div></template></question></panel></div>

<question>
<p>Which one of these is most suited for an application of the Abstraction Occurrence pattern?</p>
<ul radio-group="56836" class="radio-list">
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="56836" type="radio"> a. Stagings of a stage drama at various theatres</label></li>
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="56836" type="radio"> b. Teachers and their students</label></li>
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="56836" type="radio"> c. Courses and exams/assignments given by those courses</label></li></ul>
<template #answer><div>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>(a) Stagings of a drama are ‘occurrences’ of the drama. They have many common attributes (e.g., Drama name, producer, cast, etc.) but some attributes are different (e.g., venue, time).</p>
<p>(b) Students are not occurrences of a Teacher or vice versa.</p>
<p>(c) Course, Exam, and Assignment are distinct entities with associations among them, but none of them can be considered an occurrence of another.</p></div></template></question></panel></div></panel></div></div></div></div>
