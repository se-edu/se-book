Which one of these is most suited for an application of the Abstraction Occurrence pattern?

- ( ) a. Stagings of a stage drama at various theatres
- ( ) b. Teachers and their students
- ( ) c. Courses and exams/assignments given by those courses

<panel type="seamless" header="{{ icon_A }} Answer" minimized>

(a)

Explanation:

(a) Stagings of a drama are ‘occurrences’ of the drama. They have many common attributes (e.g., Drama name, producer, cast, etc.) but some attributes are different (e.g., venue, time).

(b) Students are not occurrences of a Teacher or vice versa.

(c) Course, Exam, and Assignment are distinct entities with associations among them, but none of them can be considered an occurrence of another.
