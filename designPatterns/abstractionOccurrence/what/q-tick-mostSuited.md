Which one of these is most suited for an application of the Abstraction Occurrence pattern?

- ( ) a. Stagings of a stage drama at various theatres
- ( ) b. Teachers and their students
- ( ) c. Modules and exams/assignments given by those modules

<div slot="answer">

(a)

Explanation:

(a) Stagings of a drama are ‘occurrences’ of the drama. They have many attributes common (e.g., Drama name, producer, cast, etc.) but some attributes are different (e.g., venue, time).

(b) Students are not occurrences of a Teacher or vice versa

(c) Module, Exam, Assignment are distinct entities with associations among them. But none of them can be considered an occurrence of another.
