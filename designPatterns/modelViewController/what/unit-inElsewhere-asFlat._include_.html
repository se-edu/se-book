<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Most applications support storage/retrieval of information, displaying of information to the user (often via multiple UIs having different formats), and changing stored information based on external inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>The high coupling that can result from the interlinked nature of the features described above.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by separating them into three different components: <em>Model</em>, <em>View</em> and <em>Controller</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>View</em>: Displays data, interacts with the user, and pulls data from the model if necessary.</li>
<li><em>Controller</em>: Detects UI events such as mouse clicks and button pushes, and takes follow up action. Updates/changes the model/view when necessary.</li>
<li><em>Model</em>: Stores and maintains data. Updates the view if necessary.</li></ul>
<p>The relationship between the components can be observed in the diagram below. Typically, the UI is the combination of <em>View</em> and <em>Controller</em>.</p>

<p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Given below is a concrete example of MVC applied to a student management system. In this scenario, the user is retrieving the data of a student.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In the diagram above, when the user clicks on a button using the UI, the ‘click’ event is caught and handled by the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>UiController</code>. The <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>ref</code> frame indicates that the interactions within that frame have been extracted out to another separate sequence diagram.</p></box>
<p>Note that in a simple UI where there’s only one view, <em>Controller</em> and <em>View</em> can be combined as one class.</p>
<p>There are many variations of the MVC model used in different domains. For example, the one used in a desktop GUI could be different from the one used in a web application.</p></div>
