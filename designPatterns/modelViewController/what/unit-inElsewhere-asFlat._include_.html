      <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
      <p>Most applications support storage/retrieval of information, displaying of information to the user (often via multiple UIs having different formats), and changing stored information based on external inputs.</p>
      <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
      <p>To reduce coupling resulting from the interlinked nature of the features described above.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>To decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by separating them into three different components: Model, View and Controller.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>View</em>: Displays data, interacts with the user, and pulls data from the model if necessary.</li>
        <li><em>Controller</em>: Detects UI events such as mouse clicks, button pushes and takes follow up action. Updates/changes the model/view when necessary.</li>
        <li><em>Model</em>: Stores and maintains data. Updates views if necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The relationship between the components can be observed in the diagram below. Typically, the UI is the combination of view and controller.</p>

        <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gift" aria-hidden="true"></span> Given below is a concrete example of MVC applied to a student management system. In this scenario, the user is retrieving data of one student.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>In the diagram above, when the user clicks on a button using the UI, the ‘click’ event is caught and handled by the <code>UiController</code>.</p>
      </tip-box>
      <p>Note that in a simple UI where there’s only one view, Controller and View can be combined as one class.</p>
      <p>There are many variations of the MVC model used in different domains. For example, the one used in a desktop GUI could be different from the one used in a Web application.</p>
