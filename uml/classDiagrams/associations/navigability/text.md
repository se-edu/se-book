**Use arrowheads to indicate the navigability of an association.**

{{ icon_example }} In this example, the navigability is unidirectional, and is from the `Logic` class to the `Minefield` class. That means if a `Logic` object `L` is associated with a `Minefield` object `M`, `L` has a reference to `M` but `M` doesn't have a reference to `L`.

{{ icon_example }} Here is an example of a bidirectional navigability; i.e., if a `Dog` object `d` is associated with a `Man` object `m`, `d` has a reference to `m` and `m` has a reference to `d`.<p/>

**Navigability can be shown in class diagrams as well as object diagrams**.

{{ icon_example }} According to this object diagram, the given `Logic` object is associated with and aware of two `MineField` objects.
