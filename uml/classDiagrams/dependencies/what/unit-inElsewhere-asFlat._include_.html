<p><strong>Dependencies vs associations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An association is a relationship resulting from one object keeping a reference to another object (i.e., storing an object in an instance variable). While such a relationship forms a <em>dependency</em>, we need not show that as a dependency arrow in the class diagram if the association is already indicated in the diagram. That is, showing a dependency arrow does not add any value to the diagram.<br>
Similarly, an inheritance results in a dependency from the child class to the parent class but we don't show it as a dependency arrow either, for the same reason as above.</li>
<li><strong>Use a dependency arrow to indicate a dependency only if that dependency is not already captured by the diagram in another way</strong> (for instance, as an association or an inheritance) e.g., class <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Foo</code> accessing a constant in <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Bar</code> but there is no association/inheritance from <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Foo</code> to <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Bar</code>.</li></ul></div>
