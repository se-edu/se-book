- [ ] G1 G2 H1 H2
- [ ] G1 H1 G2 H2
- [ ] G1 H1 H2 G2

<div slot="answer">

All three are supported.<br>
Reason: actions in parallel paths can interleave with each other, provided,

1. all paths are completed eventually (e.g., G1 <span class="text-danger">H1</span> G2 is not compliant), and,
1. actions in each path follow the given order (e.g., G1 <span class="text-danger">H2</span> G2 <span class="text-danger">H1</span> is not compliant).
