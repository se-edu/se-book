An activity diagram (AD) captures an _activity_ of _actions_ and _control flows_ that makes up the activity. 
* An _action_ is a single step in an activity. It is shown as a rectangle with ==rounded corners==. 
* A _control flow_ shows the flow of control from one action to the next. It is shown by drawing a line with an arrow-head to show the direction of the flow.

Note the slight difference between the _start node_ and the _end node_ which represent the start and the end of the activity, respectively.
