<div slot="answer">

* i : :+1: Correct. The arrow-head type does not matter. 
* ii : Incorrect. The start and end node notation is swapped.
* iii : Incorrect. Action boxes should have rounded corners.
* iv : :+1: Correct. An activity can have only one action.
* v : Incorrect. There cannot be any double-headed arrows.
