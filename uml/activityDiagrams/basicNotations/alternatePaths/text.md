#### Alternate Paths :two:

<div id="body">

_Branch nodes_ and _merge nodes_ have the same notation: a **diamond** shape. They are used to show alternative (not parallel) paths through the AD. Each control flow exiting a _Branch node_ has a guard condition which allows control to flow only if the guard condition is satisfied. Therefore, a _guard_ is a boolean condition that should be true for execution to take a specific path.

Example: AD for the Minesweeper (MS) that shows actions done by the player and the game (MS).
