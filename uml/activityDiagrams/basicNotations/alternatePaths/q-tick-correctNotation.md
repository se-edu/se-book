<div slot="answer">

* i: :+1: Correct. There can be more than two alternate paths.
* ii: :+1: Correct. An alternate path can divide into more branches.
* iii: :+1: Correct. A branch can join other branches.
* iv: Incorrect. At `x = 5` both guard conditions become true.
* v: :+1: Correct. It is fine for a branch to form a loop by going back to the original branch node.
* vi: Incorrect. Guard conditions should be given in square brackets.
