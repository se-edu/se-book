Notes:
 * The class name and object name e.g. `car1:Car` are underlined.
 * `objectName:ClassName` is meant to say 'an instance of `ClassName` identified as `objectName`'.
 * Unlike classes, there is no compartment for methods.
 * _Attributes_ compartment can be omitted if it is not relevant to the task at hand.
 * Object name can be omitted too e.g. `:Car` which is meant to say 'an _unnamed_ instance of a Car object'.
