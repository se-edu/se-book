**An object diagram shows an object structure at a given point of time.** While a class diagram defines the static structure of a system in terms of classes and their relationships, an object diagram shows a concrete snapshot of that class structure at a particular moment by depicting specific instances and how they are linked. In essence, **object diagrams are instantiations of class diagrams**, depicting runtime states of a class structure.
