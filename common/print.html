                  <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
                    <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things,
                      especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things,
                      a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
                    <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and
                      to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's
                      first clay pencil holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them
                      work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer
                      has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
                    <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another
                      the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet,
                      works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of
                      the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand
                      conceptual structures....</p>
                    <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing
                      visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms.
                      The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life,
                      showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
                    <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
                    <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character,
                      one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect,
                      and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
                    <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the
                      circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
                      It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility.
                      In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
                    <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other
                      people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or test cases),
                      and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
                    <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity
                      come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
                    <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end.
                      So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
                    <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be
                      obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas.
                      Already the displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
                    <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own;
                      it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the paper one,
                      unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
                    <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design,
                      it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing.
                      The obsolescence of an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts.
                      The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
                    <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys
                      and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

                  <p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a <em>programming paradigm</em>.</strong> A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting state of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
                    <p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background against which we work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
                    <p>With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures are the basic elements of design.</p>
                    <p>Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form a complete program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>

                    <p>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data). In that, they’re not much different
                      from ordinary physical objects. It’s easy to see how a mechanical device, such as a pocket watch or a piano,
                      embodies both state and behavior. But almost anything that’s designed to do a job does, too. Even simple things
                      with no moving parts such as an ordinary bottle combine state (how full the bottle is, whether or not it’s open,
                      how warm its contents are) with behavior (the ability to dispense its contents at various flow rates, to be opened
                      or closed, to withstand high or low temperatures).</p>
                    <p>It’s this resemblance to real things that gives objects much of their power and appeal. They can not only model
                      components of real systems, but equally as well fulfill assigned roles as components in software systems.</p>

                    <p>You are asked to find out the average age of a group of people Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy. You take a piece of paper and pen, go to each person, ask for their age, and note it down. After collecting the age of all four, you enter it into a calculator to find the total. And then, use the same calculator to divide the total by four, to get the average age. This can be viewed as the objects <code>You</code>, <code>Pen</code>, <code>Paper</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> interacting to accomplish the end result of calculating the average age of the four persons. These objects can be considered as connected in a certain network of certain structure.</p>

                  <p><strong>OOP solutions try to create a similar object network inside the computer’s memory</strong> – a sort of a virtual simulation of the corresponding real world scenario – <strong>so that a similar result can be achieved programmatically.</strong></p>

                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>create the virtual world of object network, and</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>provide it the inputs to produce the outcome we want.</strong></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><strong>A <mark><em>class</em></mark> contains instructions for creating a specific kind of objects</strong>. It turns out sometimes multiple objects have the same behavior because they are of the <em>same kind</em>. Instructions for creating a one kind (or ‘class’) of objects can be done once and that same instructions can be used to <tooltip content="i.e. create"><em>instantiate</em></tooltip> objects of that kind. We call such instructions a <em>Class</em>.</p>

                    <p>Consider the example of writing an OOP program to calculate the average age of Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy.</p>
                    <p>Instructions for creating objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> will be very similar because they are all of the same kind : they all represent ‘persons’ with the same interface, the same kind of data (i.e. <code>name</code>, <code>DoB</code>, etc.), and the same kind of behavior (i.e. <code>getAge(Date)</code>, <code>getName()</code>, etc.). Therefore, we can have a class called <code>Person</code> containing instructions on how to create <code>Person</code> objects and use that class to instantiate objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code>.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, we need classes <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> classes to instantiate one each of <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> objects.</p>

However, this opens the possibility of an invalid values such as <code>9</code> to be assigned to it. But if you define an enumeration type called <code>Priority</code> that has three values <code>HIGH</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, <code>LOW</code> only, a variable of type <code>Priority</code> will never be assigned an invalid value because the compiler is able to catch such an error.</p>

                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> For example, you can use inheritance to define an <code>EvaluationReport</code> class based on an existing <code>Report</code> class so that the <code>EvaluationReport</code> class does not have to duplicate code that is already implemented in the <code>Report</code> class. The <code>EvaluationReport</code> can inherit the <code>wordCount</code> attribute and the <code>print()</code> method from the <em>base class</em> <code>Report</code>.</p>
                  </tip-box>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Other names for Base class: <em>Parent</em> class, <em>Super</em> class</li>
                    <li>Other names for Derived class: <em>Child</em> class, <em>Sub</em> class, <em>Extended</em> class</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>A superclass is said to be <em>more general</em> than the subclass.</strong> Conversely, a subclass is said to be more <em>specialized</em> than the superclass.</p>
                  <p><strong>Applying inheritance on a group of similar classes can result in the common parts among classes being extracted into more general classes.</strong></p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code> behaves the same way for certain things. However, the two classes cannot be simply replaced with a more general class <code>Person</code> because of the need to distinguish between <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code> for certain other things. A solution is to add the <code>Person</code> class as a superclass (to contain the code common to men and woment) and let <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code> inherit from <code>Person</code> class.</p>
                  </tip-box>
                  <p><strong>Inheritance implies the derived class can be considered as a <em>sub-type</em> of the base class (and the base class is a <em>super-type</em> of the derived class), resulting in an <em>is a</em> relationship.</strong></p>
                  <p><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-info-circle"></span></span> Inheritance does not necessarily mean a sub-type relationship exists. However, the two often go hand-in-hand. For simplicity, at this point let us assume inheritance implies a sub-type relationship.</span></p>

                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> To continue the previous example,</p>

                      <li><code>Man</code> <em>is a</em> <code>Person</code></li>
                    </ul>
                  </tip-box>
                  <p><strong>Inheritance relationships through a chain of classes can result in inheritance <em>hierarchies</em> (aka inheritance <em>trees</em>).</strong></p>

                  <p><strong><em>Multiple Inheritance</em> is when a class inherits <em>directly</em> from multiple classes.</strong> Multiple inheritance among classes is allowed in some languages (e.g., Python, C++) but not in other languages (e.g., Java, C#).</p>

                    <p>There are a number of situations in software engineering when it is important for disparate groups of programmers to agree to a &quot;contract&quot; that spells out how their software interacts.

Some examples:</p>

                      <li>Declare an array of type <code>Animal</code> and still be able to store <code>Dog</code> and <code>Cat</code> objects in it.</li>

                  <p><strong>Three concepts combine to achieve polymorphism: <em>substitutability, operation overriding, and dynamic binding</em>.</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Substitutability:</strong> Because of substitutability, you can write code that expects object of a parent class and yet use that code with objects of child classes. That is how polymorphism is able to <em>treat objects of different types as one type</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overriding:</strong> To get polymorphic behavior from an operation, the operation in the superclass needs to be overridden in each of the subclasses. That is how overriding allows objects of different subclasses to <em>display different behaviors in response to the same method call</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic binding</strong>: Calls to overridden methods are bound to the implementation of the actual object's class dynamically during the runtime. That is how the polymorphic code can call the method of the parent class and yet execute the implementation of the child class.</li>

                  <p><strong>What’s the difference between a Class, an Abstract Class, and an Interface?</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>An interface is a behavior specification with no implementation.</li>
                    <li>A class is a behavior specification + implementation.</li>
                    <li>An abstract class is a behavior specification + a possibly incomplete implementation.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>How does overriding differ from <em>overloading</em>?</strong></p>
                  <p>Overloading is used to indicate that multiple operations do similar things but take different parameters. Overloaded methods have the same method name but different method signatures and possibly different return types.</p>
                  <p>Overriding is when a sub-class redefines an operation using the same method name and the same type signature. Overridden methods have the same name, same method signature, and same return type.</p>

                    <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br>
                          Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong>
                          Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br>
                          Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br>
                          For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>
                          When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br>
                          When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br>
                          When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
                      </ul>

                    uses User stories to capture requirements.
                    <p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/userstories.html">This page</a> in their website explains the difference between user stories and traditional requirements.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>

                  <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p>

                  <p>💡 Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200">
                  </tip-box>
                  <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code> is not to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
                  <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
                  <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph.
                    Use cases should be easy to read. Note that there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
                  <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
                    <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
                    <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
                    <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

                    <li>Lowers the understandability of modules as it is difficult to express module functionalities at a higher level.</li>
                    <li>Lowers maintainability because a module can be modified due to unrelated causes <span class="dimmed"> (reason: the module contains code unrelated to each other)</span> or many many modules may need to be modified to achieve a small change in behavior <span class="dimmed"> (reason: because the code realated to that change is not localized to a single module)</span>.</li>

                      <p><strong><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploit models as blueprints.</strong> MDD uses models as primary engineering artifacts when developing software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can even involve manual translation from model to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to generate code from models and maintain the link between models and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise, but it is still an emerging technology</p>

                    <p>The analysis process for identifying objects and object classes is recognized as one of the most difficult areas of object-oriented development. <sub>--<a href="http://www.software-engin.com/">Ian Sommerville, in the book <em>Software Engineering</em></a></sub></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the <tooltip content="the relevant information that needs to be examined to understand a problem">problem domain</tooltip> (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). <strong>Class diagrams are used to model the problem domain are called <em>conceptual class diagrams</em> or <em>OO domain models (OODMs)</em>.</strong></p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
                    <p>Description: Snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>The above OO domain model omits the ladder class for simplicity. It can be included in a similar fashion to the Snake class.</p>
                  </tip-box>
                  <p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not usually in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
                  <p><strong>OODMs represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem domain</strong> and not their behavior, just like class diagrams. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
                  <p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but typically omit methods and navigability.</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>A <em>State Machine Diagram</em> models state-dependent behavior.</strong></p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Consider how a CD player responds when the “eject CD” button is pushed:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>If the CD tray is already open, it does nothing.</li>
                      <li>If the CD tray is already in the process of opening (opened half-way), it continues to open the CD tray.</li>
                      <li>If the CD tray is closed and the CD is being played, it stops playing and opens the CD tray.</li>
                      <li>If the CD tray is closed and CD is not being played, it simply opens the CD tray.</li>
                      <li>If the CD tray is already in the process of closing (closed half-way), it waits until the CD tray is fully closed and opens it immediately afterwards.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What this means is that the CD player’s response to pushing the “eject CD” button depends on what it was doing at the time of the event. More generally, the CD player’s response to the event received depends on its internal state. Such a behavior is called a <em>state-dependent behavior</em>.</p>
                  </tip-box>
                  <p>Often, state-dependent behavior displayed by an object in a system is simple enough that it needs no extra attention; such a behavior can be as simple as a <em>conditional</em> behavior like <code>if x&gt;y, then x=x-y</code>.
                    Occasionally, objects may exhibit state-dependent behavior that is complex enough such that it needs to be captured into a separate model. Such state-dependent behavior can be modelled using UML <em>state machine diagrams</em> (SMD for short, sometimes also called ‘state charts’, ‘state diagrams’ or ‘state machines’).</p>
                  <p>An SMD views the life-cycle of an object as consisting of a finite number of states where each state displays a unique behavior pattern. An SMD captures information such as the states an object can be in, during its lifetime, and how the object responds to various events while in each state and how the object transits from one state to another. In contrast to sequence diagrams that capture object behavior one scenario at a time, SMDs capture the object’s behavior over its full life cycle.</p>

                  <p>Let us start by modelling a sample interaction between the person playing the game and the <code>TextUi</code> object.</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingASolution/basic/images/playerText.png" height="300">
                    <p></p>
                    <p><code>newgame</code> and <code>clear x y</code> represent commands typed by the <code>Player</code> on the <code>TextUi</code>.</p>
                  </tip-box>
                  <p>How does the <code>TextUi</code> object carry out the requests it has received from player? It would need to interact with other objects of the system. Because the <code>Logic</code> class is the one that controls the game logic, the <code>TextUi</code> needs to collaborate with <code>Logic</code> to fulfill the <code>newgame</code> request. Let us extend the model to capture that interaction.</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingASolution/basic/images/playerTextLogic.png" height="280">
                    <p></p>
                    <p><code>W</code> = Width of the minefield; <code>H</code> = Height of the minefield</p>
                  </tip-box>
                  <p>The above diagram assumes that <code>W</code> and <code>H</code> are the only information <code>TextUi</code> requires to display the minefield to the <code>Player</code>. Note that there could be other ways of doing this.<br>
                    The <code>Logic</code> methods we conceptualized in our modelling so far are:</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingASolution/basic/images/textLogicMinefieldCell.png" height="115"></tip-box>
                  <p>Now, let us look at what other objects and interactions are needed to support the <code>newGame()</code> operation. It is likely that a new <code>Minefield</code> object is created when the <code>newGame()</code> method is called.</p>
                  <tip-box>

                  <p>Note that the behavior of the <code>Minefield</code> constructor has been abstracted away. It can be designed at a later stage.</p>
                  <p>Given below are the interactions between the player and the Text UI for the whole game.</p>

                                      <p>Suppose You are planning to implement a simple minesweeper game that has a text based UI and a GUI. Given below is a possible OOP design for the game.</p>

                                      <p>To answer those questions, you can analyze the how the objects of these classes will interact with each other to produce the behavior you want.</p>

                            <p>Let us start by modelling a sample interaction between the person playing the game and the <code>TextUi</code> object.</p>
                            <tip-box>
                              <img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingASolution/basic/images/playerText.png" height="300">

                              <p><code>newgame</code> and <code>clear x y</code> represent commands typed by the <code>Player</code> on the <code>TextUi</code>.</p>
                            </tip-box>
                            <p>How does the <code>TextUi</code> object carry out the requests it has received from player? It would need to interact with other objects of the system. Because the <code>Logic</code> class is the one that controls the game logic, the <code>TextUi</code> needs to collaborate with <code>Logic</code> to fulfill the <code>newgame</code> request. Let us extend the model to capture that interaction.</p>
                            <tip-box>
                              <img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingASolution/basic/images/playerTextLogic.png" height="280">

                              <p><code>W</code> = Width of the minefield; <code>H</code> = Height of the minefield</p>
                            </tip-box>
                            <p>The above diagram assumes that <code>W</code> and <code>H</code> are the only information <code>TextUi</code> requires to display the minefield to the <code>Player</code>. Note that there could be other ways of doing this.<br>
                              The <code>Logic</code> methods we conceptualized in our modelling so far are:</p>

                            <p>Now, let us look at what other objects and interactions are needed to support the <code>newGame()</code> operation. It is likely that a new <code>Minefield</code> object is created when the <code>newGame()</code> method is called.</p>
                            <tip-box>
                              <img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingASolution/basic/images/logicMinefield.png" height="150"></tip-box>
                            <p>Note that the behavior of the <code>Minefield</code> constructor has been abstracted away. It can be designed at a later stage.</p>
                            <p>Given below are the interactions between the player and the Text UI for the whole game.</p>

                  <p>This interaction adds the following methods to the <code>Logic</code> class</p>

                    <li><code>clearCellAt(int x, int y)</code></li>

                  <p>And it adds the following operation to Logic API:</p>

                    <li><code>getAppearanceOfCellAt(int,int):CELL_APPEARANCE (CELL_APPEARANCE: HIDDEN, ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE, …, MARKED, INCORRECTLY_MARKED, INCORRECTLY_CLEARED)</code></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In the above design, <code>TextUi</code> does not access <code>Cell</code> objects directly. Instead, it gets values of type <code>CELL_APPEARANCE</code> from <code>Logic</code> to be displayed as a minefield to the player. Alternatively, each cell or the entire Minefield can be passed directly to <code>TextUi</code>.</p>
                  <p>Here is the updated class diagram:</p>

                  <p>The above is for the case when Actor <code>Player</code> interacts with the system using a text UI. Additional operations (if any) required for the GUI can be discovered similarly.
                    Suppose <code>Logic</code> supports a <code>reset()</code> operation. We can model it like this:</p>

                    <img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/logicMinefieldReset.png" height="100"></tip-box>
                  <p>Our current model assumes that the <code>Minefield</code> object has enough information (i.e. H, W, and mine locations) to create itself.</p>

                  </tip-box>
                  <p>An alternative is to have a <code>ConfigGenerator</code> object that generates a string containing the minefield information as shown below.</p>

                  <p>In addition, <code>getWidth()</code>, <code>getHeight()</code>, <code>markCellAt(x,y)</code> and <code>clearCellAt(x,y)</code> can be handled like this.</p>

                  <p>How is <code>getGameState()</code> operation supported? Given below are two ways (there could be other ways):</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><code>Minefield</code> class knows the state of the game at any time. <code>Logic</code> class retrieves it from the <code>Minefield</code> class as and when required.</li>
                    <li><code>Logic</code> class maintains the state of the game at all times.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Here’s the SD for option 1.</p>

                    <p>💡 When designing components, it is not necessary to draw elaborate UML diagrams capturing all details of the design. They can be done as rough sketches. For example, draw sequence diagrams only when you are not sure which operations are required by each class, or when you want to verify that your class structure can indeed support the required operations.</p>

                  <p><strong>The <em>service-oriented architecture</em> (SOA) style builds applications by combining functionalities packaged as <em>programmatically accessible services</em></strong>. SOA aims to achieve interoperability between distributed services, which may not even be implemented using the same programming language. A common way to implement SOA is through the use of <em>XML web services</em> where the web is used as the medium for the services to interact, and XML is used as the language of communication between service providers and service users.</p>

Using these web services, an ‘eBookShop’ web application can be developed that allows HSBC customers to buy merchandise from Amazon and pay for them using HSBC credit cards. Because both Amazon and HSBC services follow the SOA architecture, their web services can be reused by the web application, even if all three systems use different programming platforms.</p>

                  <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
                  <p>A certain classes should have no more than just one instance (e.g. the main controller class of the system). These single instances are commonly known as <em>singletons</em>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                  <p>A normal class can be instantiated multiple times by invoking the constructor.</p>
                  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                  <p>Make the constructor of the singleton class <code>private</code>, <span class="dimmed"> because a <code>public</code> constructor will allow others to instantiate the class at will</span>.

                </p>
                <div>
                  <p>Here is the typical implementation of how the Singleton pattern is applied to a class:</p>
                  <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Logic</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> Logic theOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-title">Logic</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
        ...
    }

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> Logic <span class="hljs-title">getInstance</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (theOne == <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>) {
            theOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic();
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> theOne;
    }
}
</code></pre>
                  <p>Notes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The constructor is <code>private</code>, which prevents instantiation from outside the class.</li>
                    <li>The single instance of the singleton class is maintained by a <code>private</code> class-level variable.</li>
                    <li>Access to this object is provided by a <code>public</code> class-level operation <code>getInstance()</code> which instantiates a single copy of the singleton class when it is executed for the first time. Subsequent calls to this operation return the single instance of the class.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If <code>Logic</code> was not a Singleton class, an object is created like this:</p>
                  <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic m = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic();
</code></pre>
                  <p>But now, the <code>Logic</code> object needs to be accessed like this:</p>
                  <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic m = Logic.getInstance();
</code></pre>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>easy to apply</li>
                    <li>effective in achieving its goal with minimal extra work</li>
                    <li>provides an easy way to access the singleton object from anywhere in the code base</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The singleton object acts like a global variable that increases coupling across the code base.</li>
                    <li>In testing, it is difficult to replace Singleton objects with stubs (static methods cannot be overridden)</li>
                    <li>In testing, singleton objects carry data from one test to another even when we want each test to be independent of the others.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Given there are some significant cons, it is recommended that you apply the Singleton pattern when, in addition to requiring only one instance of a class, there is a risk of creating multiple objects by mistake, and creating such multiple objects has real negative consequences.</p>

                  <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
                  <p>There is a group of similar entities that appears to be ‘occurrences’ (or ‘copies’) of the same thing, sharing lots of common information, but also differing in significant ways.</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> In a library, there can be multiple copies of same book title. Each copy shares common information such as book title, author, ISBN etc. However, there are also significant differences like purchase date and barcode number (assumed to be unique for each copy of the book).</p>
                    <p>Other examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Episodes of the same TV series</li>
                      <li>Stock items of the same product model (e.g. TV sets of the same model).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </tip-box>
                  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                  <p>Representing the objects mentioned previously as a single class would be problematic because it results in duplication of data which can lead to inconsistencies in data (if some of the duplicates are not updated consistently).</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Take for example the problem of representing books in a library. Assume that there could be multiple copies of the same title, bearing the same ISBN number, but different serial numbers.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>The above solution requires common information to be duplicated by all instances. This will not only waste storage space, but also creates a consistency problem. Suppose that after creating several copies of the same title, the librarian realized that the author name was wrongly spelt. To correct this mistake, the system needs to go through every copy of the same title to make the correction. Also, if a new copy of the title is added later on, the librarian (or the system) has to make sure that all information entered is the same as the existing copies to avoid inconsistency.</p>

                  <p><strong>Anti-pattern</strong></p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Refer to the same Library example given above.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>The design above segregates the common and unique information into a class hierarchy. Each book title is represented by a separate class with common data (i.e. Name, Author, ISBN) hard-coded in the class itself. This solution is problematic because each book title is represented as a class, resulting in thousands of classes (one for each title). Every time the library buys new books, the source code of the system will have to be updated with new classes.</p>
                  </tip-box>
                  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                  <p>Let a copy of an entity (e.g. a copy of a book)be represented by two objects instead of one, separating the common and unique information into two classes to avoid duplication.</p>

                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Here's a more generic example:</p>

                  <p>The general solution:</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Abstraction &gt;&gt;</code> class should hold all common information, and the unique information should be kept by the <code>&lt;&lt; Occurrence &gt;&gt;</code> class. Note that ‘Abstraction’ and ‘Occurrence’ are not class names, but roles played by each class. Think of this diagram as a <em>meta-model</em> (i.e. a ‘model of a model’) of the <code>BookTitle-BookCopy</code> class diagram given above.</p>

                  <p>A system is required to execute a number of commands, each doing a different task. For example, a system might have to support <code>Sort</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Reset</code> commands.</p>
                  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                  <p>It is preferable that some part of the code executes these commands without having to know each command type. <span class="dimmed"> e.g., there can be a <code>CommandQueue</code> object that is responsible for queuing commands and executing them without knowledge of what each command does.</span></p>
                  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                  <p>The essential element of this pattern is to have a general <code>&lt;&lt;Command&gt;&gt;</code> object that can be passed around, stored, executed, etc without knowing the type of command (i.e. via polymorphism).</p>
                  <p>Let us examine an example application of the pattern first:</p>

                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> In the example solution below, the <code>CommandCreator</code> creates <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset Command</code> objects and adds them to the <code>CommandQueue</code> object. The <code>CommandQueue</code> object treats them all as <code>Command</code> objects and performs the execute/undo operation on each of them without knowledge of the specific <code>Command</code> type. When executed, each <code>Command</code> object will access the <code>DataStore</code> object to carry out its task. The <code>Command</code> class can also be an abstract class or an interface.</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p>The <code>&lt;&lt;Client&gt;&gt;</code> creates a <code>&lt;&lt;ConcreteCommand&gt;&gt;</code> object, and passes it to the <code>&lt;&lt;Invoker&gt;&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;&lt;Invoker&gt;&gt;</code> object treats all commands as a general <code>&lt;&lt;Command&gt;&gt;</code> type. <code>&lt;&lt;Invoker&gt;&gt;</code> issues a request by calling <code>execute()</code> on the command. If a command is undoable, <code>&lt;&lt;ConcreteCommand&gt;&gt;</code> will store the state for undoing the command prior to invoking <code>execute()</code>. In addition, the <code>&lt;&lt;ConcreteCommand&gt;&gt;</code> object may have to be linked to any <code>&lt;&lt;Receiver&gt;&gt;</code> of the command (<tooltip content="the object the command will operate on, in case different commands operate on different objects">?</tooltip>) before it is passed to the <code>&lt;&lt;Invoker&gt;&gt;</code>.

                  <p>The high coupling that can result from the interlinked nature of the features described above.</p>
                  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                  <p>Decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by separating them into three different components: <em>Model</em>, <em>View</em> and <em>Controller</em>.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>View</em>: Displays data, interacts with the user, and pulls data from the model if necessary.</li>
                    <li><em>Controller</em>: Detects UI events such as mouse clicks, button pushes and takes follow up action. Updates/changes the model/view when necessary.</li>
                    <li><em>Model</em>: Stores and maintains data. Updates views if necessary.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The relationship between the components can be observed in the diagram below. Typically, the UI is the combination of view and controller.</p>

                  <p>An object (possibly, more than one) is interested to get notified when a change happens to another object. That is, some objects want to ‘observe’ another object.</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Consider this scenario from the a student management system where the user is adding a new student to the system.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>Now, assume the system has two additional views used in parallel by different users:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>StudentListUi</code>: that accesses a list of students and</li>
                      <li><code>StudentStatsUi</code>: that generates statistics of current students.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When a student is added to the database using <code>NewStudentUi</code> shown above, both <code>StudentListUi</code> and <code>StudentStatsUi</code> should get updated automatically, as shown below.</p>

                    <p>However, the <code>StudentList</code> object has no knowledge about <code>StudentListUi</code> and <code>StudentStatsUi</code> (note the direction of the navigability) and has no way to inform those objects. This is an example of the type of problem addressed by the Observer pattern.</p>

Any number of <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code> objects can observe (i.e. listen to changes of) the <code>&lt;&lt;Observable&gt;&gt;</code> object.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;&lt;Observable&gt;&gt;</code> maintains a list of <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code> objects. <code>addObserver(Observer)</code> operation adds a new <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code> to the list of <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;s</code>.</li>
                    <li>Whenever there is a change in the <code>&lt;&lt;Observable&gt;&gt;</code>, the <code>notifyObservers()</code> operation is called that will call the <code>update()</code> operation of all <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;s</code> in the list.</li>

                  <p><strong>Design patterns are usually embedded in a larger design and sometimes applied in combination with other design patterns.</strong></p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Let us look at a case study that shows how design patterns are used in the design of a class structure for a Stock Inventory System (SIS) for a shop. The shop sells appliances, and accessories for the appliances. SIS simply stores information about each item in the store.</p>
                    <p><strong>Use Cases</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Create a new item</li>
                      <li>View information about an item</li>
                      <li>Modify information about an item</li>
                      <li>View all available accessories for a given appliance</li>
                      <li>List all items in the store</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>SIS can be accessed using multiple terminals. Shop assistants use their own terminals to access SIS, while the shop manager’s terminal continuously displays a list of all items in store. In the future, it is expected that suppliers of items use their own applications to connect to SIS to get real-time information about current stock status. User authentication is not required for the current version, but may be required in the future.</p>
                    <p>A step by step explanation of the design is given below. Note that this is one out of many possible designs. Design patterns are also applied where appropriate.</p>
                    <p>A <code>StockItem</code> can be an Appliance or an Accessory.</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItem.png" height="100">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>To track that each <code>Accessory</code> is associated with the correct <code>Appliance</code>, consider the following alternative class structures.</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeOne.png" height="120">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The third one seems more appropriate (the second one is suitable if accessories can have accessories). Next, consider between keeping a list of <code>Appliances</code>, and a list of <code>StockItems</code>. Which is more appropriate?</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeTwo.png" height="100">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The latter seems more suitable because it can handle both appliances and accessories the same way. Next, an abstraction occurrence pattern is applied to keep track of <code>StockItems</code>.</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeThree.png" height="100">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Note the inclusion of navigabilities. Here’s a sample object diagram based on the class model created thus far.</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItemListObjectDiagram.png" height="150">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Next, apply the façade pattern to shield the SIS internals from the UI.</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withFacade.png" height="200">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>As UI consists of multiple views, the MVC pattern is applied here.</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withMVC.png" height="270">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Some views need to be updated when the data change; apply the Observer pattern here.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>In addition, the Singleton pattern can be applied to the façade class.</p>

                  <p><strong>Knowing more patterns is a way to become more ‘experienced’.</strong> Aim to learn at least the context and the problem of patterns <span class="dimmed"> so that when you encounter those problems you know where to look for a solution</span>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Some patterns are domain-specific</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. patterns for distributed applications</span>, <strong>some are created in-house</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. patterns in the company/project</span> and <strong>some can be self-created</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. from past experience</span>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Be careful not to overuse patterns.</strong> Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they are needed. Before applying a pattern, make sure that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>there is substantial improvement in the design, not just superficial.</li>
                    <li>the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).</li>

                  <p>The notion of capturing design ideas as &quot;patterns&quot; is usually attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>. He is a building architect noted for his theories about design. His book <em>Timeless way of building</em> talks about &quot;design patterns&quot; for constructing buildings.</p>
                  <p>Here is a sample pattern from that book:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>When a room has a window with a view, the window becomes a focal point: people are attracted to the window and want to look through it. The furniture in the room creates a second focal point:
                      everyone is attracted toward whatever point the furniture aims them at (usually the center of the room or a TV). This makes people feel uncomfortable. They want to look out the window,
                      and toward the other focus at the same time. If you rearrange the furniture, so that its focal point becomes the window, then everyone will suddenly notice that the
                      room is much more “comfortable”</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Apparently, patterns and anti-patterns are found in the field of building architecture. This is because they are general concepts applicable to any domain, not just software design. In software engineering, there are many general types of patterns: Analysis patterns, Design patterns, Testing patterns, Architectural patterns, Project management patterns, and so on.</p>
                  <p>In fact, the abstraction occurrence pattern is more of an analysis pattern than a design pattern, while MVC is more of an architectural pattern.</p>
                  <p>New patterns can be created too. If a common problem needs to be solved frequently that leads to a non-obvious and better solution, it can be formulated as a pattern so that it can be reused by others. However, don’t reinvent the wheel; the pattern might already exist.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Top-down: Design the high-level design first and flesh out the lower levels later. This is especially useful when designing big and novel systems where the high-level design needs to be stable before lower levels can be designed.</li>
                    <li>Bottom-up: Design lower level components first and put them together to create the higher-level systems later. This is not usually scalable for bigger systems. One instance where this approach might work is when designing a variations of an existing system or re-purposing existing components to build a new system.</li>
                    <li>Mix: Design the top levels using the top-down approach but switch to a bottom-up approach when designing the bottom levels.</li>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Agile designs are emergent, they’re not defined up front.</strong> Your overall system design will emerge over time, evolving to fulfill new requirements and take advantage of new technologies as appropriate. Although you will often do <strong>some initial architectural modeling at the very beginning</strong> of a project, this will be just enough to get your team going. This approach does not produce a fully documented set of models in place before you may begin coding. <sub>-- adapted from <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDesign.htm">agilemodeling.com</a></sub></p>

                  <p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.</strong></p>
                  <p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
                    <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
                    <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
                    <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Examples of popular IDEs:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Java: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans</li>
                    <li>C#, C++: Visual Studio</li>
                    <li>Swift: XCode</li>
                    <li>Python: PyCharm</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Some Web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>
                  <p>Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p>

This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
                        <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
                        <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
                      </ul>

                  <p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to be read, understood, and modified by other developers later on. Even if we do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because we all become 'strangers' to our own code someday.</p>

For example, instead of declaring the variable 'state' as an integer and using values 0,1,2 to denote the states 'starting', 'enabled', and 'disabled' respectively, declare 'state' as type <code>SystemState</code> and define an enumeration <code>SystemState</code> that has values <code>'STARTING'</code>, <code>'ENABLED'</code>, and <code>'DISABLED'</code>.</li>

For example, you can use blank lines to group related statements together.
                            Sometimes, the correctness of your code does not depend on the order in which you perform certain intermediary steps. Nevertheless, this order may affect the clarity of the story you are trying to tell. Choose the order that makes the story most readable.</p>

                          <p><strong>Optimizing code prematurely has several drawbacks</strong>:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>We may not know which parts are the real performance bottlenecks</strong>. This is especially the case when the code undergoes transformations (e.g. compiling, minifying, transpiling, etc.) before it becomes an executable. Ideally, you should use a profiler tool to identify the actual bottlenecks of the code first, and optimize only those parts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimizing can complicate the code</strong>, affecting correctness and understandability</li>
                            <li><strong>Hand-optimized code can be harder for the compiler to optimize</strong> (the simpler the code, the easier for the compiler to optimize it). In many cases a compiler can do a better job of optimizing the runtime code if you don't get in the way by trying to hand-optimize the source code.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>A popular saying in the industry is <strong><em>make it work, make it right, make it fast</em></strong> which means in most cases getting the code to perform correctly should take priority over optimizing it. If the code doesn't work correctly, it has no value on matter how fast/efficient it it.</p>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming. <sub>--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a></sub></p>

                          <p>Note that <strong>there are cases where optimizing takes priority over other things</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. when writing code for resource-constrained environments</span>. This guideline simply a caution that you should optimize only when it is really needed.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The guiding principle of abstraction is that only details that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand needs to be considered.</strong> As most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details, it is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. That is where abstraction can help.</p>

                          <p>The happy path (i.e. the execution path taken when everything goes well) should be clear and prominent in your code. Restructure the code to make the happy path unindented as much as possible. It is the ‘unusual’ cases that should be indented.

                  <p><strong>One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow a strict coding standard (aka <em>style guide</em>).</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person</strong>. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use <em>Hungarian style</em>, <em>Pascal casing</em>, <em>Camel casing</em>, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally inconsistent with typical industry practices. <span class="dimmed">If a company's coding standards is very different from what is used typically in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.</span></p>
                  <p>💡 IDEs can help to enforce some parts of a coding standard e.g. indentation rules.</p>

                              <li><code>colorBlack</code> : hex value for color black</li>

                              <li><code>colorBlue</code> : number of times blue is used</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>This is misleading because <code>colorBlue</code> is named similar to <code>colorWhite</code> and <code>colorBlack</code> but has a different purpose while <code>hexForRed</code> is named differently but has very similar purpose to the first two variables. The following is better:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><code>hexForBlack</code> <code>hexForWhite</code> <code>hexForRed</code></li>
                              <li><code>blueColorCount</code></li>

                          <p>Avoid misleading or ambiguous names (e.g. those with multiple meanings), similar sounding names, hard-to-pronounce ones (e.g. avoid ambiguities like &quot;is that a lowercase L, capital I or number 1?&quot;, or &quot;is that number 0 or letter O?&quot;), almost similar names.</p>

This also applies to the final <code>else</code> of an <code>if-else</code> construct. That is, the final <code>else</code> should mean 'everything else', and not the final option.

                  <p>The first version of the code you write may not be of production quality. It is OK to first concentrate on making the code work, rather than worry over the quality of the code, as long as you improve the quality later. This process of <strong>improving a program's internal structure in small steps without modifying its external behavior is called <em>refactoring</em>.</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Refactoring is not rewriting</strong>: Discarding poorly-written code entirely and re-writing it from scratch is not refactoring because refactoring needs to be done in small steps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refactoring is not bug fixing</strong>: By definition, refactoring is different from bug fixing or any other modifications that alter the external behavior (e.g. adding a feature) of the component in concern.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p>💡 Improving code structure can have many secondary benefits: e.g.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>hidden bugs become easier to spot</li>
                      <li>improve performance (sometimes, simpler code runs faster than complex code because simpler code is easier for the compiler to optimize).</li>

But how much refactoring is too much refactoring? <strong>It is too much refactoring when the benefits no longer justify the cost.</strong> The costs and the benefits depend on the context. That is why some refactorings are ‘opposites’ of each other (e.g. <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html"><em>extract method</em></a> vs <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/inlineMethod.html"><em>inline method</em></a>).</p>

                  <p>Here are some tips on writing effective documentation.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use plenty of diagrams</strong>: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
                    <li><strong>Use plenty of examples</strong>: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use simple and direct explanations</strong>: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get rid of statements that do not add value</strong>: For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
                    <li><strong>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact</strong>, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the indiscriminate inclusion of diagrams without justifying their need, indicates a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain something. If you want to provide additional diagrams for completeness' sake, include them in the appendix as a reference.</li>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Aim for 'just enough' developer documentation.</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Writing and maintaining developer documents is an overhead. You should try to minimize that overhead.</li>
                    <li>If the readers are developers who will eventually read the code, the documentation should complement the code and should provide only just enough guidance to get started.</li>

                <div>
                  <p>Anything that is already clear in the code need not be described in words. Instead, <strong>focus on providing higher level information that is not readily visible in the code or comments</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Refrain from duplicating chunks or text. When describing several similar algorithms/designs/APIs, etc., do not simply duplicate large chunks of text. Instead, <strong>describe the similarity in one place and emphasize only the differences in other places.</strong> It is very annoying to see pages and pages of similar text without any indication as to how they differ from each other.</p>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>Most languages allow code that encountered an &quot;exceptional&quot; situation to encapsulate details of the situation in an <em>Exception</em> object and <em>throw</em>/<em>raise</em> that object so that another piece of code can <em>catch</em> it and deal with it.</strong> This is especially useful when the code that encountered the unusual situation does not know how to deal with it.</p>
                  <p>The extract below from the <small><span style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="badge badge-secondary">-- Java Tutorial</span></span></small> (with slight adaptations) explains how exceptions are typically handled.</p>
                  <div class="indented">
                    <p><strong>When an error occurs at some point in the execution, the code being executed creates an <em>exception object</em> and hands it off to the runtime system.</strong> The exception object contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called <em>throwing</em> an exception.</p>
                    <p><strong>After a method throws an exception, the runtime system attempts to find something to handle it in the <tooltip content="the ordered list of methods that had been called to get to the method where the error occurred"><em>call stack</em></tooltip>.</strong> The runtime system searches the call stack for a method that contains a block of code that can handle the exception. This block of code is called an <em>exception handler</em>. The search begins with the method in which the error occurred and proceeds through the call stack in the reverse order in which the methods were called. When an appropriate handler is found, the runtime system passes the exception to the handler. An exception handler is considered appropriate if the type of the exception object thrown matches the type that can be handled by the handler.</p>
                    <p><strong>The exception handler chosen is said to <em>catch</em> the exception.</strong> If the runtime system exhaustively searches all the methods on the call stack without finding an appropriate exception handler, the program terminates.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Advantages of exception handling in this way:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The ability to propagate error information through the call stack.</li>
                    <li>The separation of code that deals with 'unusual' situations from the code that does the 'usual' work.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong><em>Assertions</em> are used to define assumptions about the program state so that the runtime can verify them.</strong> An assertion failure indicates a possible bug in the code <span class="dimmed">because the code has resulted in a program state that violates an assumption about how the code <em>should</em> behave</span>.</p>

                  <p>Consider two classes, <code>Account</code> and <code>Guarantor</code>, with an association as shown in the following diagram:</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/errorHandling/defensiveProgramming/compulsoryAssociations/images/accountGuarantor.png" height="50">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Here, the association is compulsory i.e. an <code>Account</code> object should always be linked to a <code>Guarantor</code>. One way to implement this is to simply use a reference variable, like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Account</span> </span>{
    Guarantor guarantor;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">setGuarantor</span><span class="hljs-params">(Guarantor g)</span> </span>{
        guarantor = g;
    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>However, what if someone else used the <code>Account</code> class like this?</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java">Account a = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Account();
a.setGuarantor(<span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>);
</code></pre>
                    <p>This results in an <code>Account</code> without a <code>Guarantor</code>! In a real banking system, this could have serious consequences! The code here did not try to prevent such a thing from happening. We can make the code more defensive by proactively enforcing the multiplicity constraint, like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Account</span> </span>{

            stopSystemWithMessage(<span class="hljs-string">"multiplicity violated. Null Guarantor"</span>);
        }
        guarantor = g;
    }
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">setGuarantor</span> <span class="hljs-params">(Guarantor g)</span></span>{

            stopSystemWithMessage(<span class="hljs-string">"multiplicity violated. Null Guarantor"</span>);
        }
        guarantor = g;
    }
    …
}

                  <p>Consider the association given below. A defensive implementation requires to ensure a <code>MinedCell</code> cannot exist without a <code>Mine</code> and vice versa which requires simultaneous object creation. However, Java can only create one object at a time. Given below are two alternatives implementations, both of which violate the multiplicity for a short period of time.</p>

}
</code></pre>
                  <p>Option 1 forces us to keep a <code>Mine</code> without a <code>MinedCell</code> (until the <code>MinedCell</code> is created).</p>
                  <p>Option 2:</p>

</code></pre>
                  <p>Option 2 is more defensive because the <code>Mine</code> is immediately linked to a <code>MinedCell</code>.</p>

                  <p>Now James' girlfriend is Jean, while Jean's boyfriend is not James. This situation results as the code was not defensive enough to stop this &quot;love triangle&quot;. In such a situation, we say that <em>the referential integrity has been violated</em>. It simply means <em>there is an inconsistency in object references</em>.</p>

                  <p>Suppose an operation is implemented with the behavior specified precisely in the API (preconditions, post conditions, exceptions etc.). When following the defensive approach, the code should first check if the preconditions have been met. Typically, exceptions are thrown if preconditions are violated. In contrast, the <em>Design-by-Contract (DbC)</em> approach to coding assumes that it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure all preconditions are met. The operation will honor the contract only if the preconditions have been met. If any of them have not been met, the behavior of the operation is &quot;unspecified&quot;.</p>
                  <p>Languages such as Eiffel have native support for DbC. For example, preconditions of an operation can be specified in Eiffel and the language runtime will check precondition violations without the need to do it explicitly in the code. To follow the DbC approach in languages such as Java and C++ where there is no built-in DbC support, assertions can be used to confirm pre-conditions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Stub</strong>: A stub has the same interface as the component it replaces, but its implementation is so simple that it is unlikely to have any bugs. It mimics the responses of the component, but only for the a limited set of predetermined inputs. That is, it does not know how to respond to any other inputs. Typically, these mimicked responses are hard-coded in the stub rather than computed or retrieved from elsewhere, e.g. from a database.</p>

                  <p><strong>Build automation tools automate the steps of the build process, usually by means of build scripts.</strong></p>
                  <p>In a non-trivial project, building a product from source code can be a complex multi-step process. <span class="dimmed"> For example, it can include steps such as to pull code from the revision control system, compile, link, run automated tests, automatically update release documents (e.g. build number), package into a distributable, push to repo, deploy to a server, delete temporary files created during building/testing, email developers of the new build, and so on. Furthermore, this build process can be done ‘on demand’, it can be scheduled (e.g. every day at midnight) or it can be triggered by various events (e.g. triggered by a code push to the revision control system).</span></p>
                  <p>Some of these build steps such as to compile, link and package are already automated in most modern IDEs. <span class="dimmed"> For example, several steps happen automatically when the ‘build’ button of the IDE is clicked. Some IDEs even allow customization to this build process to some extent.</span></p>
                  <p>However, most big projects use specialized build tools to automate complex build processes.</p>

                  <p><strong>Some build tools also serve as <em>dependency management tools</em></strong>. Modern software projects often depend on third party libraries that evolve constantly. That means developers need to download the correct version of the required libraries and update them regularly. Therefore, dependency management is an important part of build automation. Dependency Management tools can automate that aspect of a project.</p>

                  <p>Reuse is a major theme in software engineering practices. <strong>By reusing tried-and-tested components, the robustness of a new software system can be enhanced while reducing the manpower and time requirement.</strong> Reusable components come in many forms; it can be reusing a piece of code, a subsystem, or a whole software.</p>

                  <p>While you may be tempted to use many libraries/frameworks/platform that seem to crop up on a regular basis and promise to bring great benefits, note that <strong>there are costs associated with reuse</strong>. Here are some:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The reused code <strong>may be an overkill</strong> (think <em>using a sledgehammer to crack a nut</em>) increasing the size of, or/and degrading the performance of, your software.</li>
                    <li>The reused software <strong>may not be mature/stable enough</strong> to be used in an important product. That means the software can change drastically and rapidly, possibly in ways that break your software.</li>
                    <li>Non-mature software has the <strong>risk of dying off</strong> as fast as they emerged, leaving you with a dependency that is no longer maintained.</li>
                    <li>The license of the reused software (or its dependencies) <strong>restrict how you can use/develop your software</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The reused software <strong>might have bugs, missing features, or security vulnerabilities</strong> that are important to your product but not so important to the maintainers of that software, which means those flaws will not get fixed as fast as you need them to.</li>
                    <li><strong>Malicious code can sneak into your product</strong> via compromised dependencies.</li>

                  <p><strong>An <em>Application Programming Interface (API)</em> specifies the interface through which other programs can interact with a software component.</strong> It is a contract between the component and its clients.</p>

                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> A class has an API (e.g., <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">API of the Java <code>String</code> class</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">API of the Python <code>str</code> class</a>) which is a collection of public methods that you can invoke to make use of the class.</p>

                  <p>When developing large systems, if you define the API of each components early, the development team can develop the components in parallel <span class="dimmed"> because the future behavior of the other components are now more predictable</span>.</p>

                  <p>An API should be well-designed (i.e. should cater for the needs of its users) and well-documented.</p>
                  <p>When we write software consisting of multiple components, we need to define the API of each component.</p>
                  <p>One approach is to let the API emerge and evolve over time as we write code.</p>
                  <p>Another approach is to define the API up-front. Doing so allows us to develop the components in parallel.</p>
                  <p>We can use UML <em>sequence diagrams</em> to analyze the required interactions between components in order to discover the required API. Given below is an example.</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <img src="/se-book/reuse/apis/designingAPIs/images/textLogic.png" height="500">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>As we analyze the interactions between components using sequence diagrams, we discover the API of those components. For example, the diagram above tells us that the MSLogic component API should have the methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>new()</code></li>
                      <li><code>getWidth:int</code></li>
                      <li><code>getHeight():int</code></li>
                      <li><code>getRemainingMineCount():int</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>More details can be included to increase the precision of the method definitions before coding. Such precision is important to avoid misunderstandings between the developer of the class and developers of other classes that interact with this class.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Operation</strong>: <em>newGame(): void</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Description</strong>: Generates a new <em>WxH</em> minefield with <em>M</em> mines. Any existing minefield will be overwritten.</li>
                      <li><strong>Preconditions</strong>: None</li>
                      <li><strong>Postconditions</strong>: A new minefield is created. Game state is READY.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Preconditions are the conditions that must be true before calling this operation. Postconditions describe the system after the operation is complete. Note that post conditions do not say what happens during the operation. Here is another example:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Operation</strong>: <em>clearCellAt(int x, int y): void</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Description</strong>: Records the cell at x,y as cleared.</li>
                      <li><strong>Parameters</strong>: x, y coordinates of the cell</li>
                      <li><strong>Preconditions</strong>: game state is READY or IN_PLAY. x and y are in 0..(H-1) and 0..(W-1), respectively.</li>
                      <li><strong>Postconditions</strong>: Cell at x,y changes state to ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE, …, EIGHT, or INCORRECTLY_CLEARED. Game state changes to IN_PLAY, WON or LOST as appropriate.</li>

                  <p><strong>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over the network</strong>, rather than a product running on a local machine. This means the actual hardware and software is located at a remote location, typically, at a large server farm, while users access them over the network. Maintenance of the hardware and software is managed by the cloud provider while users typically pay for only the amount of services they use. This model is similar to the consumption of electricity; the power company manages the power plant, while the consumers pay them only for the electricity used. The cloud computing model optimizes hardware and software utilization and reduces the cost to consumers. Furthermore, users can scale up/down their utilization at will without having to upgrade their hardware and software. The traditional non-cloud model of computing is similar to everyone buying their own generators to create electricity for their own use.</p>

                  <p>Cloud computing can deliver computing services at three levels:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) delivers computer infrastructure as a service.</strong> For example, a user can deploy virtual servers on the cloud instead of buying physical hardware and installing server software on them. Another example would be a customer using storage space on the cloud for off-site storage of data. <span class="dimmed"> Rackspace is an example of an IaaS cloud provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is another one.</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS) provides a platform on which developers can build applications.</strong> Developers do not have to worry about infrastructure issues such as deploying servers or load balancing as is required when using IaaS. Those aspects are automatically taken care of by the platform. The price to pay is reduced flexibility; applications written on PaaS are limited to facilities provided by the platform. <span class="dimmed"> A PaaS example is the Google App Engine where developers can build applications using Java, Python, PHP, or Go whereas Amazon EC2 allows users to deploy application written in any language on their virtual servers.</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Software as a service (SaaS) allows applications to be accessed over the network</strong> instead of installing them on a local machine. <span class="dimmed"> For example, Google Docs is an SaaS word processing software, while Microsoft Word is a traditional word processing software.</span></p>

                  <p><strong>Software <em>Quality Assurance</em> (QA) is the process of ensuring that the software being built has the required levels of quality.</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Quality Assurance = Validation + Verification</strong></p>
                  <p>QA involves checking two aspects:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Validation: are we <em>building the right system</em> i.e., are the requirements correct?</li>
                    <li>Verification: are we <em>building the system right</em> i.e., are the requirements implemented correctly?</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is both are done, instead of limiting to verification (i.e., remember that the requirements can be wrong too).</p>

                            <li>the author - the creator of the artifact</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Formal verification can be used to prove the absence of errors</strong>. In contrast, testing can only prove the presence of error, not their absence.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Disadvantages:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It only proves the compliance with the specification, but not the actual utility of the software.</li>
                    <li>It requires highly specialized notations and knowledge which makes it an expensive technique to administer. Therefore, <strong>formal verifications are more commonly used in safety-critical software such as flight control systems</strong>.</li>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Software testing consists of the <em>dynamic</em> verification that a program provides <em>expected</em> behaviors on a <em>finite</em> set of test cases, suitably <em>selected</em> from the usually infinite execution domain. <sub>-– source: <a href="https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3">Software Engineering Book of Knowledge V3</a></sub></p>

                    <p>Some things to note (indicated by keywords in the above definition):</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><em>Dynamic</em>: Testing involves executing the software. It is not by examining the code statically.</li>
                      <li><em>Finite</em>: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.</li>
                      <li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
                      <li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li>

</code></pre>
                    <p>Normally, you would use the <code>Logic</code> class as follows (not how the <code>Logic</code> object depends on a <code>DatabaseStorage</code> object to perform the <code>getName()</code> operation):</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic logic = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> DatabaseStorage());
String name = logic.getName(<span class="hljs-number">23</span>);
</code></pre>
                    <p>You can test it like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Test</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">getName</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

    assertEquals(<span class="hljs-string">"Name: John"</span>, logic.getName(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>));
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>However, this <code>logic</code> object being tested is making use of a <code>DataBaseStorage</code> object which means a bug in the <code>DatabaseStorage</code> class can affect the test. Therefore, this test is not testing <code>Logic</code> <em>in isolation from its dependencies</em> and hence it is not a pure unit test.</p>
                    <p>Here is a stub class you can use in place of <code>DatabaseStorage</code>:</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">StorageStub</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">implements</span> <span class="hljs-title">Storage</span> </span>{

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Note how the stub has the same interface as the real dependency, is so simple that it is unlikely to contain bugs, and is pre-configured to respond with a hard-coded response, presumably, the correct response <code>DatabaseStorage</code> is expected to return for the given test input.</p>
                    <p>Here is how you can use the stub to write a unit test. This test is not affected by any bugs in the <code>DatabaseStorage</code> class and hence is a pure unit test.</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Test</span>

                  <p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
                  <p><strong>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system.</strong> Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails 'gracefully' having pushed beyond its limits.</p>

                    <li><strong>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space;</strong> in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due to multiple inter-related bugs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework</strong>, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification <span class="dimmed">i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>One bug might 'hide' other bugs</strong>, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
                    <li><strong>The delivery may have to be delayed</strong> if too many bugs were found during testing.</li>
                  </ul>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong> First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’ <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em> because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where more faults are found.</p>

                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Here is an example thought process behind a segment of an exploratory testing session:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon.
                        But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works, even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>

                  <p>Which approach is better – <strong>scripted or exploratory? A mix is better.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition.</strong> Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled or inexperienced testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While <strong>exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means of testing a critical system</strong>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time</strong>, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar systems.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations benefit from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches.

                  <p><strong>A simple way to semi-automate testing of a CLI(Command Line Interface) app is by using input/output re-direction.</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>First, we feed the app with a sequence of test inputs that is stored in a file while redirecting the output to another file.</li>
                    <li>Next, we compare the actual output file with another file containing the expected output.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Let us assume we are testing a CLI app called <code>AddressBook</code>. Here are the detailed steps:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>Store the test input in the text file <code>input.txt</code>.</p>

                          <p>💡 The way to run a CLI program differs based on the language.<br>
                            e.g., In Python, assuming the code is in <code>AddressBook.py</code> file, use the command<br>
                            <code>python AddressBook.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>💡 If you are using Windows, use a normal command window to run the app, not a Power Shell window.</p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                        <p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> operators. For example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
                        <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code> (or any other filename) makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

                  <p>If a software product has a GUI component, all product-level testing (i.e. the types of testing mentioned above) need to be done using the GUI. However, <strong>testing the GUI is much harder than testing the CLI (command line interface) or API</strong>, for the following reasons:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Most GUIs can support a large number of different operations, many of which can be performed in any arbitrary order.</li>
                    <li>GUI operations are more difficult to automate than API testing. Reliably automating GUI operations and automatically verifying whether the GUI behaves as expected is harder than calling an operation and comparing its return value with an expected value. Therefore, automated regression testing of GUIs is rather difficult.</li>
                    <li>The appearance of a GUI (and sometimes even behavior) can be different across platforms and even environments. For example, a GUI can behave differently based on whether it is minimized or maximized, in focus or out of focus, and in a high resolution display or a low resolution display.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p></p>
                  <p><strong>One approach to overcome the challenges of testing GUIs is to minimize logic aspects in the GUI.</strong> Then, bypass the GUI to test the rest of the system using automated API testing. While this still requires the GUI to be tested manually, the number of such manual test cases can be reduced as most of the system has been tested using automated API testing.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Test coverage</em> is a metric used to measure the extent to which testing exercises the code</strong> i.e., how much of the code is 'covered' by the tests.</p>
                  <p>Here are some examples of different coverage criteria:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Function/method coverage</strong> : based on functions executed <span class="dimmed"> e.g., testing executed 90 out of 100 functions</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statement coverage</strong> : based on the number of line of code executed <span class="dimmed"> e.g., testing executed 23k out of 25k LOC</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision/branch coverage</strong> : based on the decision points exercised <span class="dimmed"> e.g., an <code>if</code> statement evaluated to both <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> with separate test cases during testing is considered 'covered'</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Condition coverage</strong> : based on the boolean sub-expressions, each evaluated to both true and false with different test cases. Condition coverage is not the same as the decision coverage.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> <code>if(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44)</code> is considered one decision point but two conditions.</p>
                    <p>For 100% branch or decision coverage, two test cases are required:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == true</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 4</code>]</li>
                      <li><code>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 100</code>]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For 100% condition coverage, three test cases are required</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>(x &gt; 2) == true</code> , <code>(x &lt; 44) == true</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 4</code>]</li>
                      <li><code>(x &lt; 44) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 100</code>]</li>
                      <li><code>(x &gt; 2) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 0</code>]</li>
                    </ul>
                  </tip-box>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Path coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible paths through a given part of the code executed. 100% path coverage means all possible paths have been executed. A commonly used notation for path analysis is called the <em>Control Flow Graph (CFG)</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Entry/exit coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible <em>calls to</em> and <em>exits</em> from the operations in the SUT.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Measuring coverage is often done using <em>coverage analysis tools</em>.</strong> Most IDEs have inbuilt support for measuring test coverage, or at least have plugins that can measure test coverage.</p>
                  <p><strong>Coverage analysis can be useful in improving the quality of testing</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., if a set of test cases does not achieve 100% branch coverage, more test cases can be added to cover missed branches</span>.</p>

It mimics the responses of the component, but only for the a limited set of predetermined inputs. That is, it does not know how to respond to any other inputs.

</code></pre>
                              <p>Normally, you would use the <code>Logic</code> class as follows (not how the <code>Logic</code> object depends on a <code>DatabaseStorage</code> object to perform the <code>getName()</code> operation):</p>
                              <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic logic = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> DatabaseStorage());
String name = logic.getName(<span class="hljs-number">23</span>);
</code></pre>
                              <p>You can test it like this:</p>
                              <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Test</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">getName</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    Logic logic = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> DatabaseStorage());
    assertEquals(<span class="hljs-string">"Name: John"</span>, logic.getName(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>));
}
</code></pre>
                              <p>However, this <code>logic</code> object being tested is making use of a <code>DataBaseStorage</code> object which means a bug in the <code>DatabaseStorage</code> class can affect the test. Therefore, this test is not testing <code>Logic</code> <em>in isolation from its dependencies</em> and hence it is not a pure unit test.</p>
                              <p>Here is a stub class you can use in place of <code>DatabaseStorage</code>:</p>
                              <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">StorageStub</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">implements</span> <span class="hljs-title">Storage</span> </span>{

    <span class="hljs-meta">@Override</span>
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> String <span class="hljs-title">getName</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> index)</span> </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(index == <span class="hljs-number">5</span>) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Adam"</span>;
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> UnsupportedOperationException();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                              <p>Note how the stub has the same interface as the real dependency, is so simple that it is unlikely to contain bugs, and is pre-configured to respond with a hard-coded response, presumably, the correct response <code>DatabaseStorage</code> is expected to return for the given test input.</p>
                              <p>Here is how you can use the stub to write a unit test. This test is not affected by any bugs in the <code>DatabaseStorage</code> class and hence is a pure unit test.</p>
                              <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Test</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">getName</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

                                <p><strong>Stub</strong>: A stub has the same interface as the component it replaces, but its implementation is so simple that it is unlikely to have any bugs. It mimics the responses of the component, but only for the a limited set of predetermined inputs. That is, it does not know how to respond to any other inputs. Typically, these mimicked responses are hard-coded in the stub rather than computed or retrieved from elsewhere, e.g. from a database.</p>

                              <p>Normally, you would use the <code>Logic</code> class as follows (not how the <code>Logic</code> object depends on a <code>DatabaseStorage</code> object to perform the <code>getName()</code> operation):</p>
                              <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic logic = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> DatabaseStorage());
String name = logic.getName(<span class="hljs-number">23</span>);
</code></pre>
                              <p>You can test it like this:</p>
                              <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Test</span>

    assertEquals(<span class="hljs-string">"Name: John"</span>, logic.getName(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>));
}
</code></pre>
                              <p>However, this <code>logic</code> object being tested is making use of a <code>DataBaseStorage</code> object which means a bug in the <code>DatabaseStorage</code> class can affect the test. Therefore, this test is not testing <code>Logic</code> <em>in isolation from its dependencies</em> and hence it is not a pure unit test.</p>
                              <p>Here is a stub class you can use in place of <code>DatabaseStorage</code>:</p>
                              <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">StorageStub</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">implements</span> <span class="hljs-title">Storage</span> </span>{

    }
}
</code></pre>
                              <p>Note how the stub has the same interface as the real dependency, is so simple that it is unlikely to contain bugs, and is pre-configured to respond with a hard-coded response, presumably, the correct response <code>DatabaseStorage</code> is expected to return for the given test input.</p>
                              <p>Here is how you can use the stub to write a unit test. This test is not affected by any bugs in the <code>DatabaseStorage</code> class and hence is a pure unit test.</p>

                      <p><strong><em>Black-box</em> (aka <em>specification-based or responsibility-based</em>) approach</strong>: test cases are designed exclusively based on the SUT’s specified external behavior.</p>

                      <p><strong><em>White-box</em> (aka <em>glass-box or structured or implementation-based</em>) approach</strong>: test cases are designed based on what is known about the SUT’s implementation, i.e. the code.</p>

                  <p>It is inefficient and impractical to test this method for all integer values <code>[-MIN_INT to MAX_INT]</code>. Fortunately, there is no need to test all possible input values. For example, if the input value <code>233</code> failed to produce the correct result, the input <code>234</code> is likely to fail too; there is no need to test both.</p>
                  <p>In general, <strong>most SUTs do not treat each input in a unique way. Instead, they process all possible inputs in a small number of distinct ways.</strong> That means a range of inputs is treated the same way inside the SUT.

                    <p>As <code>newGame()</code> does not have any parameters, the only obvious participant is the <code>Logic</code> object itself.</p>
                    <p>Note that if the glass-box or the grey-box approach is used, other associated objects that are involved in the method might also be included as participants. For example, <code>Minefield</code> object can be considered as another participant of the <code>newGame()</code> method. Here, the black-box approach is assumed.</p>
                    <p>Next, let us identify equivalence partitions for each participant. Will the <code>newGame()</code> method behave differently for different <code>Logic</code> objects? If yes, how will it differ? In this case, yes, it might behave differently based on the game state. Therefore, the equivalence partitions are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>PRE_GAME</code> : before the game starts, minefield does not exist yet</li>
                      <li><code>READY</code> : a new minefield has been created and waiting for player’s first move</li>
                      <li><code>IN_PLAY</code> : the current minefield is already in use</li>
                      <li><code>WON</code>, <code>LOST</code> : let us assume the <code>newGame</code> behaves the same way for these two values</li>
                    </ul>

                  <p>It looks like the test cases were created using the <em>at least once</em> strategy. After running these tests can we confirm that square-format label printing is done correctly?</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Answer: No.</li>
                    <li>Reason: <code>Cherry</code> -- the only input that can produce a square-format label -- is in a negative test case which produces an error message instead of a label. If there is a bug in the code that prints labels in square-format, these tests cases will not trigger that bug.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In this case a useful heuristic to apply is <strong>each valid input must appear at least once in a positive test case</strong>. <code>Cherry</code> is a valid test input and we must ensure that it appears at least once in a positive test case. Here are the updated test cases after applying that heuristic.</p>

                  <p>Next, let us assume that there is a dependency between the inputs <code>examScore</code> and <code>isAbsent</code> such that an absent student can only have <code>examScore=0</code>. To cater for the hidden invalid case arising from this, we can add a new test case where <code>isAbsent=true</code> and <code>examScore!=0</code>. In addition, test cases 3-6.2 should have <code>isAbsent=false</code> so that the input remains valid.</p>

                  <p><strong>Use cases can be used for system testing and acceptance testing</strong>. For example, the main success scenario can be one test case while each variation (due to extensions) can form another test case. However, note that use cases do not specify the exact data entered into the system. Instead, it might say something like <code>user enters his personal data into the system</code>. Therefore, the tester has to choose data by considering equivalence partitions and boundary values. The combinations of these could result in one use case producing many test cases.</p>
                  <p>To increase <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:usebaseBased-EandE">E&amp;E of testing</trigger>, high-priority use cases are given more attention. For example, a <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:usecaseBased-scripted">scripted approach</trigger> can be used to test high priority test cases, while an exploratory approach is used to test other areas of concern that could emerge during testing.</p>

                        </li>

                          <p><strong>Testing should be <em>efficient</em></strong> i.e., it has a high rate of success (bugs found/test cases) <span class="dimmed">a set of 20 test cases that finds 8 defects is more efficient than another set of 40 test cases that finds the same 8 defects</span>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Scripted testing:</strong> First write a set of test cases based on the expected behavior of the SUT, and then perform testing based on that set of test cases.</p>

                              <li>
                                <p><strong>Exploratory testing:</strong> Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</p>

                            <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’ <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:exploratoryWhat-bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em> because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where more faults are found.</p>

                                  But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works, even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information.</strong> In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
                        <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
                        <p><strong>Revision control software will track the history and evolution of your project</strong>, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
                        <p><strong>Revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong> when you're working with other people. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
                        <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
                        <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself, or with a hundred other people.</p>

                  <p><strong>You can <mark><em>clone</em></mark> a remote repo onto your computer</strong> which will create a copy of a remote repo on your computer, including the version history as the remote repo.</p>
                  <p><strong>You can <mark><em>push</em></mark> new commits in your clone to the remote repo</strong> which will copy the new commits onto the remote repo. Note that pushing to a remote repo requires you to have write-access to it.</p>
                  <p><strong>You can <mark><em>pull</em></mark> from the remote repos to receive new commits in the remote repo</strong>. Pulling is used to <em>sync</em> your local repo with latest changes to the remote repo.</p>
                  <p>While it is possible to set up your own remote repo on a server, an easier option is to use a remote repo hosting service such as GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
                  <p><strong>A <mark><em>fork</em></mark> is a remote copy of a remote repo</strong>. If there is a remote repo that you want to push to but you do not have write access to it, you can fork the remote repo, which gives you your own remote repo that you can push to.</p>
                  <p><strong>A <mark><em>pull request</em></mark> is mechanism for contributing code to a remote repo.</strong> It is a formal request sent to the maintainers of the repo asking them to pull your new code to their repo.</p>

                  <p><strong>Centralized RCS (CRCS for short)uses a central remote repo that is shared by the team.</strong> Team members download (‘pull’) and upload (‘push’) changes between their own local repositories and the central repository. Older RCS tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model. Note that these older RCS do not support the notion of a local repo either. Instead, they force users to do all the versioning with the remote repo.</p>

                  <p><strong>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS) allows multiple remote repos</strong> and pulling and pushing can be done among them in arbitrary ways. The workflow can vary differently from team to team. For example, every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in the diagram below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support the distributed approach.</p>

                  <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                  <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                    <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                    <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                    <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                    <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                    <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                    <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>

                  <p><strong>A <em>buffer</em> is a time set aside to absorb any unforeseen delays.</strong> It is very important to include buffers in a software project schedule because effort/time estimations for software development is notoriously hard. However, <strong>do not inflate task estimates to create hidden buffers</strong>; have explicit buffers instead. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: With explicit buffers it is easier to detect incorrect effort estimates which can serve as a feedback to improve future effort estimates.</span></p>

                  <p>Keeping track of project tasks <span class="dimmed">(who is doing what, which tasks are ongoing, which tasks are done etc.)</span> is an essential part of project management. In small projects it may be possible to track tasks using simple tools as online spreadsheets or general-purpose/light-weight tasks tracking tools such as Trello. Bigger projects need more sophisticated task tracking tools.</p>
                  <p><strong>Issue trackers (sometimes called bug trackers) are commonly used to track task assignment and progress.</strong> Most online project management software such as GitHub, SourceForge, and BitBucket come with an integrated issue tracker.</p>

                  <p>Given below are three commonly used team structures in software development. Irrespective of the team structure, it is a good practice to assign roles and responsibilities to different team members so that someone is clearly in charge of each aspect of the project. In comparison, the ‘everybody is responsible for everything’ approach can result in more chaos and hence slower progress.</p>
                  <img src="/se-book/teamwork/teamStructures/images/diagram.png" height="150">
                  <p></p>
                  <p><strong>Egoless team</strong></p>
                  <p>In this structure, <strong>every team member is equal in terms of responsibility and accountability</strong>. When any decision is required, consensus must be reached. This team structure is also known as a <em>democratic</em> team structure. This team structure usually finds a good solution to a relatively hard problem as all team members contribute ideas.</p>
                  <p>However, the democratic nature of the team structure bears a higher risk of falling apart due to the absence of an authority figure to manage the team and resolve conflicts.</p>
                  <p><strong>Chief programmer team</strong></p>
                  <p>Frederick Brooks proposed that software engineers learn from the medical surgical team in an operating room. In such a team, there is always a chief surgeon, assisted by experts in other areas. Similarly, in a chief programmer team structure, <strong>there is a single authoritative figure, the chief programmer</strong>. Major decisions, e.g. system architecture, are made solely by him/her and obeyed by all other team members. The chief programmer directs and coordinates the effort of other team members. When necessary, the chief will be assisted by domain specialists e.g. business specialists, database expert, network technology expert, etc. This allows individual group members to concentrate solely on the areas where they have sound knowledge and expertise.</p>
                  <p>The success of such a team structure relies heavily on the chief programmer. Not only must he be a superb technical hand, he also needs good managerial skills. Under a suitably qualified leader, such a team structure is known to produce successful work. .</p>
                  <p><strong>Strict hierarchy team</strong></p>
                  <p>In the opposite extreme of an egoless team, a strict hierarchy team has <strong>a strictly defined organization among the team members</strong>, reminiscent of the military or bureaucratic government. Each team member only works on his assigned tasks and reports to a single “boss”.</p>
                  <p>In a large, resource-intensive, complex project, this could be a good team structure to reduce communication overhead.</p>

                  <p><strong>Software development goes through different stages such as <em>requirements, analysis, design, implementation</em> and <em>testing</em>. These stages are collectively known as the <em>software development life cycle</em> (SDLC).</strong> There are several approaches, known as <em>software development life cycle models</em> (also called <em>software process models</em>) that describe different ways to go through the SDLC. Each process model prescribes a &quot;roadmap&quot; for the software developers to manage the development effort. The roadmap describes the aims of the development stage(s), the artifacts or outcome of each stage as well as the workflow i.e. the relationship between stages.</p>

                  <p><strong>The <em>sequential model</em>, also called the <em>waterfall</em> model, models software development as a linear process</strong>, in which the project is seen as progressing steadily in one direction through the development stages. The name <em>waterfall</em> stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p><strong>When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage.</strong> For example, upon completion of the requirement stage a comprehensive list of requirements is produced that will see no further modifications. A strict application of the sequential model would require each stage to be completed before starting the next.</p>
                  <p><strong>This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable.</strong> In such cases, using the sequential model should result in a timely and systematic development effort, provided that all goes well. As each stage has a well-defined outcome, the progress of the project can be tracked with a relative ease.</p>
                  <p><strong>The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and keep changing over time.</strong> One reason for this is that users are generally not aware of how a software application can be used without prior experience in using a similar application.</p>

                <div>
                  <p><strong>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC.</strong> Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement gathering to testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p><strong>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product.</strong> Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable version from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.</p>
                  <p><strong>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>breadth-first</strong>: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.</li>
                    <li><strong>depth-first</strong>: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Most project use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations.</strong> Hence, the common phrase ‘an iterative and incremental process’.</p>

                  <p>In 2001, a group of prominent software engineering practitioners met and brainstormed for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes that were used in most large projects at the time. This resulted in something called the <em>agile manifesto</em> (a vision statement of what they were looking to do).</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
                    <p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
                      <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
                      <li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
                      <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>
                      <sub>Extract from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a></sub></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Subsequently, some of the signatories of the manifesto went on to create process models that try to follow it. These processes are collectively called agile processes. Some of the key features of agile approaches are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Requirements are prioritized based on the needs of the user, are clarified regularly (at times almost on a daily basis) with the entire project team, and are factored into the development schedule as appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Instead of doing a very elaborate and detailed design and a project plan for the whole project, the team works based on a rough project plan and a high level design that evolves as the project goes on.</li>
                    <li>Strong emphasis on complete transparency and responsibility sharing among the team members. The team is responsible together for the delivery of the product. Team members are accountable, and regularly and openly share progress with each other and with the user.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>There are a number of agile processes in the development world today. <em>eXtreme Programming (XP)</em> and <em>Scrum</em> are two of the well-known ones.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Extreme Programming (XP) stresses customer satisfaction.</strong> Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it.</p>
                    <p><strong>XP aims to empower developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements</strong>, even late in the life cycle.</p>
                    <p><strong>XP emphasizes teamwork.</strong> Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. XP implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around the problem to solve it as efficiently as possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>XP aims to improve a software project in five essential ways: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage.</strong> Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design simple and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. Every small success deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every team member. With this foundation, Extreme Programmers are able to courageously respond to changing requirements and technology.</p>
                    <p><strong>XP has a set of simple rules.</strong> XP is a lot like a jig saw puzzle with many small pieces. Individually the pieces make no sense, but when combined together a complete picture can be seen. This flow chart shows how Extreme Programming's rules work together.</p>

                    <p><strong>Scrum is a process skeleton that contains sets of practices and predefined roles. The main roles in Scrum are:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>The Scrum Master</strong>, who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a project manager)</li>
                      <li><strong>The Product Owner</strong>, who represents the stakeholders and the business</li>
                      <li><strong>The Team</strong>, a cross-functional group who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>A Scrum project is divided into iterations called Sprints.</strong> A sprint is the basic unit of development in Scrum. Sprints tend to last between one week and one month, and are a timeboxed (i.e. restricted to a specific duration) effort of a constant length.</p>
                    <p><strong>Each sprint is preceded by a planning meeting</strong>, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made, and followed by a review or retrospective meeting, where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified.</p>
                    <p><strong>During each sprint, the team creates a potentially deliverable product increment</strong> (for example, working and tested software). The set of features that go into a sprint come from the product backlog, which is a prioritized set of high level requirements of work to be done. Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the Product Owner informs the team of the items in the product backlog that he or she wants completed. The team then determines how much of this they can commit to complete during the next sprint, and records this in the sprint backlog. During a sprint, no one is allowed to change the sprint backlog, which means that the requirements are frozen for that sprint. Development is timeboxed such that the sprint must end on time; if requirements are not completed for any reason they are left out and returned to the product backlog. After a sprint is completed, the team demonstrates the use of the software.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members</strong>, and verbal communication between all team members and disciplines in the project.</p>
                    <p><strong>A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need</strong> (often called requirements churn), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team’s ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Daily Scrum</em> is another key scrum practice</strong>. The description below was adapted from <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum">https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com</a> (emphasis added):</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><strong>In Scrum, on each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the &quot;daily scrum.”</strong> Meetings are typically held in the same location and at the same time each day. Ideally, a daily scrum meeting is held in the morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day's work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant.</p>
                    <p>...</p>
                    <p><strong>During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
                      <li>What will you do today?</li>
                      <li>Are there any impediments in your way?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>...</p>
                    <p>The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. <strong>Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting.</strong></p>

                  <p>Given above is a visualization of a project done using the Unified process (source: Wikipedia). As the diagram shows, a phase can consist of several iterations. Each vertical column (labeled “I1” “E1”, “E2”, “C1”, etc.) represents a single iteration. Each of the iterations consists of a set of ‘workflows’ such as ‘Business modeling’, ‘Requirements’, ‘Analysis &amp; Design’ etc. The shaded region indicates the amount of resource and effort spent on a particular workflow in a particular iteration.</p>
                  <p><strong>Unified process is a flexible and customizable process model framework rather than a single fixed process.</strong> For example, the number of iterations in each phase, definition of workflows, and the intensity of a given workflow in a given iteration can be adjusted according to the nature of the project. Take the Construction Phase, to develop a simple system, one or two iterations would be sufficient. For a more complicated system, multiple iterations will be more helpful. Therefore, the diagram above simply records a particular application of the UP rather than prescribe how the UP is to be applied. However, this record can be refined and reused for similar future projects.</p>

                  <p>Note the existence of something called the <code>master</code> branch. Git allows you to have multiple branches (i.e. it is a way to evolve the content in parallel) and Git creates a default branch named <code>master</code> on which the commits go on by default.</p>
                  <p>Do some changes to <code>fruits.txt</code> (e.g. add some text and delete some text). Stage the changes, and commit the changes using the same steps you followed before. You should end up with something like this.</p>

                  <p>Next, add two more files <code>colors.txt</code> and <code>shapes.txt</code> to the same working directory. Add a third commit to record the current state of the working directory.</p>

                      <p>Now, we need to create the <em>main Java class</em> that starts up our application with the <code>RootLayout.fxml</code> and adds the <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code> in the center.</p>
                      <p>Right-click on your <code>seedu.address</code> package, and choose <code>New</code> → <code>JavaFXApplication</code>. For the class name, type <code>MainApp</code>.</p>
                      <p>The generated <code>MainApp.java</code> class extends from <code>Application</code> and contains two methods. This is the basic structure that we need to start a JavaFX Application. The most important part for us is the <code>start(Stage primaryStage)</code> method. It is automatically called when the application is <code>launch()</code> from within the <code>main()</code> method.</p>
                      <p>As you see, the <code>start(...)</code> method receives a <code>Stage</code> as parameter. The following graphic illustrates the structure of every JavaFX application:</p>

                      <p><em>It's like a theater play:</em> The <code>Stage</code> is the main container which is usually a <code>Window</code> with a border and the typical minimize, maximize and close buttons. Inside the <code>Stage</code> you add a <code>Scene</code> which can, of course, be switched out by another <code>Scene</code>. Inside the <code>Scene</code> the actual JavaFX nodes like <code>AnchorPane</code>, <code>TextBox</code>, etc. are added.</p>

                        <li>With JavaFX, it is common to use <code>*Property</code> for all fields of a model class. A <code>Property</code> allows us, for example, to automatically be notified when the <code>lastName</code> or any other variable is changed. This helps us keep the view in sync with the data.</li>
                        <li>To learn more about <code>*Property</code>, refer to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/properties-binding-tutorial/binding.htm">Using JavaFX Properties and Binding</a></li>

                      <p>The main data that our application manages is simply a bunch of persons. Let's create a list of <code>Person</code> objects inside the <code>MainApp</code> class. All other controller classes will later get access to that central list inside the <code>MainApp</code>.</p>

                      <p>We are working with JavaFX view classes that need to be informed about any changes made to the list of persons. This is important, since otherwise the view would not be in sync with the data. For this purpose, JavaFX introduces some new <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/collections-tutorial/collections.htm">Collection classes</a>.</p>
                      <p>Among all these collections, we need the <code>ObservableList</code>. To create a new <code>ObservableList</code>, add the following code at the beginning of the <code>MainApp</code> class. We'll also add a constructor that creates some sample data and a public getter method:</p>

                      <p>We have our model and view. Let's get our data into our table. We'll need a controller for our <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code> to act as a &quot;middleman&quot; for the model and view.</p>
                      <p>Create a normal Java class inside the <code>view</code> package called <code>PersonOverviewController</code>.</p>
                      <tip-box type="tip">
                        <p>Note: We must put the class inside the same package as <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code>, otherwise the SceneBuilder won't be able to find it.</p>
                      </tip-box>
                      <p>We will add some instance variables that give us access to the table and the labels inside the view. The fields and some methods have a special <code>@FXML</code> annotation. This is necessary in order for the <code>.fxml</code> file to have access to private fields and private methods. After we have everything set up in the <code>.fxml</code> file, the application will automatically fill the variables when the <code>.fxml</code> file is loaded.</p>

                  <p>Notes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Each test method is marked with a <code>@Test</code> annotation.</li>
                    <li>Tests use <code>Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual)</code> methods to compare the expected output with the actual output. If they do not match, the test will fail. JUnit comes with other similar methods such as <code>Assert.assertNull</code> and <code>Assert.assertTrue</code>.</li>
                    <li>Java code normally use camelCase for method names e.g., <code>testStringConversion</code> but when writing test methods, sometimes another convention is used: <code>whatIsBeingTested_descriptionOfTestInputs_expectedOutcome</code> e.g., <code>intDivision_zeroDivisor_exceptionThrown</code></li>
                    <li>There are <a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/exception-testing">several ways to verify the code throws the correct exception</a>. The third test method in the example above shows one of the simpler methods. If the exception is thrown, it will be caught and further verified inside the <code>catch</code> block. But if it is not thrown as expected, the test will reach <code>Assert.fail()</code> line and will fail as a result.</li>
                    <li>The easiest way to run JUnit tests is to do it via the IDE. For example, in Intellij you can right-click the folder containing test classes and choose 'Run all tests...'</li>
                    <li>Optionally, you can use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/static-import.html">static imports</a> to avoid having to specify <code>Assert.</code> everywhere.

Furthermore, the <code>Staff</code> class states that the <code>adjustMySalary</code> method will work for all positive percent values. Both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> classes override the <code>adjustMySalary</code> method.</p>

                      <li><code>Admin#adjustMySalary</code> method works for both negative and positive percent values.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li><code>Admin</code> class follows LSP because it fulfills <code>Payroll</code>’s expectation of <code>Staff</code> objects (i.e. it works for all positive values). Substituting <code>Admin</code> objects for Staff objects will not break the <code>Payroll</code> class functionality.</li>
                      <li><code>Academic</code> class violates LSP because it will not work for percent values over <code>100</code> as expected by the <code>Payroll</code> class.

However, if LSP is not followed, substituting a subclass object for a superclass object can break the functionality of the code.</p>

                                        <p>Explanation: Replacing dependencies with mocks is Dependency Injection, not DIP.

                              <li>Lowers maintainability because a module can be modified due to unrelated causes <span class="dimmed"> (reason: the module contains code unrelated to each other)</span> or many many modules may need to be modified to achieve a small change in behavior <span class="dimmed"> (reason: because the code realated to that change is not localized to a single module)</span>.</li>
                              <li>Lowers reusability of modules because they do not represent logical units of functionality.</li>

                        <li>An object should have limited knowledge of another object.</li>
                        <li>An object should only interact with objects that are closely related to it.</li>

                  </tip-box>
                  <p>More concretely, a method <code>m</code> of an object <code>O</code> should invoke only the methods of the following kinds of objects:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The object <code>O</code> itself</li>
                    <li>Objects passed as parameters of <code>m</code></li>

                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The following code fragment violates LoD due to the reason: while <code>b</code> is a ‘friend’ of <code>foo</code> (because it receives it as a parameter), <code>g</code> is a ‘friend of a friend’ (which should be considered a ‘stranger’), and <code>g.doSomething()</code> is analogous to ‘talking to a stranger’.</p>

                  <p><strong>LoD aims to prevent objects navigating internal structures of other objects.</strong></p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> An analogy for LoD can be drawn from Facebook. If Facebook followed LoD, you would not be allowed to see posts of friends of friends, unless they are your friends as well. If Jake is your friend and Adam is Jake’s friend, you should not be allowed to see Adam’s posts unless Adam is a friend of yours as well.</p>

                  <p>The principle says that some capability we presume our software needs in the future should not be built now because the chances are &quot;you aren't gonna need it&quot;.
