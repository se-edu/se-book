          <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book
            <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
            <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown
              in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
            <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay pencil
              holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
            <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer has all
              the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
            <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
            <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination.
              Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
            <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth
              and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
            <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
            <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
            <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to
              being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
            <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
              It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility. In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
            <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or test
              cases), and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
            <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
            <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
            <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas. Already the
              displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
            <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own; it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the paper
              one, unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
            <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design, it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing. The obsolescence of
              an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
            <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

          <p>A <em>software requirement</em> specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.</p>
          <p>A software project may be,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a <em>brown-field</em> project: develop a product to replace/update an existing software product</li>

          <p>There are two different kinds of requirements:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Functional requirements</strong> specify what the system should do.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong> specify the constraints under which system is developed and operated. Some examples of non-functional requirements:</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>Data requirements e.g. size, volatility, persistency etc.,</li>
            <li>Environment requirements e.g. technical environment in which system would operate or need to be compatible with.</li>
            <li>Accessibility, Capacity, Compliance with regulations, Documentation, Disaster recovery, Efficiency, Extensibility, Fault tolerance, Interoperability, Maintainability, Privacy, Portability, Quality, Reliability, Response time, Robustness, Scalability,
              Security, Stability, Testability, and more…</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Non-functional requirements are easier to miss. We should spend extra effort in digging them out as early as possible because sometimes they are critical to the success of the software. E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low
            security is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionalities.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Short timelines and limited resources often mean that you cannot implement all requirements at once. A prioritization criterion can be used to gauge the importance and urgency of requirements from the user point of view, while keeping in mind
            the constraints of schedule, budget, staff resources, and quality goals as seen by the development team.</p>
          <p>A common approach to prioritization is to group requirements into priority categories. Note that all such scales are subjective, and stakeholders define the meaning of each level in the scale for the project at hand.</p>
          <p>Here is an example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Essential</code>: The product must have this requirement fulfilled else it does not get user acceptance</li>
            <li><code>Typical</code>: Most similar systems have this feature although the product can survive without it.</li>
            <li><code>Novel</code>: New features that could differentiate this product from the rest.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>More examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>Low</code></li>
            <li><code>Must-have</code>, <code>Nice-to-have</code>, <code>Unlikely-to-have</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>At the same time, some requirements may get discarded as they are considered ‘out of scope’.</p>

                low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>

                Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson (also known as the Three Amigos). Each of them has developed their own notation for modeling software systems before joining force to create a unified modeling language (hence, the term ‘Unified’
                in UML). UML is currently the de facto modeling notation used in the industry. This handout uses UML version 2.0.</p>

            <p>Every step should clearly show <em>who</em> does <em>what</em>. A step gives the <strong>intention</strong> of the actor (not the mechanics). That means UI details are usually omitted. The idea is to leave as much flexibility to the UI designer
              as possible. That is, the use case specification should be as general as possible (less specific) about the UI. For example,</p>
            <tip-box>
              <p><code>User right-clicks the text box and chooses ‘clear’</code>: This contains UI-specific details and is not a good use case step.</p>
              <p><code>User clears the input</code>: This is better because it omits UI-specific details.</p>

            <p>When separating extensions from the MSS, keep in mind that the MSS should be self-contained. That is, the MSS should give us a complete usage scenario. Also note that it is not useful to mention events such as power failures or system crashes
              as extensions because the system cannot function beyond such catastrophic failures.</p><img src="/se-book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/details/images/extension.png" height="250">

          <p>Do not over-complicate use case diagrams.</p>
          <p><strong>System as an actor</strong></p>
          <p>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system. For example, the diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports
            at midnight.</p><img src="/se-book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="250">
          <p></p>
          <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and ‘generate daily report’ is not to be shown
            in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the ‘view daily report’ use case.</p>
          <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for Modeling Behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
          <p><strong>More on use case descriptions</strong></p>
          <p>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case. Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note that there is no strict
            rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
          <p><strong>Pros and cons</strong></p>
          <p>Here are some of the advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Since they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
            <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
            <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
            <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system. Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

              <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only details
                that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand. For example, within a certain software component, we might deal with a ‘user’ data type, while ignoring the details contained in the user data item. These details have been
                ‘abstracted away’ as they do not affect the task of that software component. This is called <em>data abstraction</em>. On the other hand, <em>control abstraction</em> abstracts away details of the actual control flow to focus on tasks
                at a simplified level. For example, <code>print(“Hello”)</code> is an abstraction of the actual output mechanism within the computer.</p>
              <p>Abstraction can be applied repeatedly to obtain higher and <em>higher levels of abstractions</em>. For example, a <code>File</code> is a data item that is at a higher level than an array and an array is at a higher level than a bit. Similarly,
                <code>execute(Game)</code> is at a higher level than <code>print(Char)</code> which is at a higher than an Assembly language instruction <code>MOV</code>.</p>

            <li>A change in one module usually forces changes in other modules coupled to it (i.e. a ripple effect).</li>
            <li>Integration is harder because multiple components coupled with each other have to be integrated at the same time.</li>
            <li>Testing and reuse of the module is harder due to its dependence on other modules.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the case of high-coupling (i.e. relatively high dependency), a change in one component may require changes in other coupled components. Therefore, we should strive to achieve a low-coupled design.</p>

          <p>While it is possible to isolate the functionalities of a software system into modules, there is no way to remove interaction between modules. When modules interact with each other, coupling naturally increases. Consequently, it is harder to
            localize any changes to the software system. In 1988, Bertrand Meyer proposed a guiding principle to alleviate this problem. The principle, known as the <em>open-closed principle</em>, states: “A module should be <em>open</em> for extension
            but <em>closed</em> for modification”. That is, modules should be written so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. In other words, changing what the modules do without changing the source code of the modules.</p>
          <p>In object-oriented programming, these two seemingly opposing requirements can be achieved in various ways. This often requires separating the <em>specification (interface)</em> of a module from its <em>implementation</em>.</p>
          <tip-box>

            <p>The behavior of the <code>CommandQueue</code> class can be altered by adding more concrete <code>Command</code> subclasses. For example, by including a <code>Delete</code> class alongside <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset</code>,
              the <code>CommandQueue</code> can now perform delete commands without modifying its code at all. Indeed, its behavior was extended without having to open up and modify its code. Hence, it was open to extensions, but closed to modification.</p>

            <p>The behavior of a Java generic class can be altered by passing it a different class as a parameter.

That is, the behavior of the <code>ArrayList</code> class is extended without modifying its code.</p>

          <p>Object Oriented Programming is a widely used programming paradigm. Here is an introductory explanation of OOP from Apple:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting
              state of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
            <p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background
              against which we work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
            <p>With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures
              are the basic elements of design.</p>
            <p>Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form a
              complete program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>

        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data). In that, they’re not much different from ordinary physical objects. It’s easy to see how a mechanical device, such as a pocket watch or a piano, embodies both state and
              behavior. But almost anything that’s designed to do a job does, too. Even simple things with no moving parts such as an ordinary bottle combine state (how full the bottle is, whether or not it’s open, how warm its contents are) with behavior
              (the ability to dispense its contents at various flow rates, to be opened or closed, to withstand high or low temperatures).</p>
            <p>It’s this resemblance to real things that gives objects much of their power and appeal. They can not only model components of real systems, but equally as well fulfill assigned roles as components in software systems.</p>

          <tip-box>
            <p>Consider the following real world scenario:</p>
            <p>You are asked to find out the average age of a group of people Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy. Take a piece of paper and pen, go to each person, ask for their age, and note it down. After collecting the age of all four, you enter it into a
              calculator to find the total. And then, use the same calculator to divide the total by four, to get the average age. This can be viewed as the objects You, Pen, Paper, Calculator, Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy interacting to accomplish
              to achieve some end result.</p>
            <p>{visual: real world scenario, objects marked}</p>

          <p>These objects can be considered as connected in a certain network of certain structure.</p>
          <p>{visual: object network marked}</p>
          <p><strong>OOP solutions try to follow a similar object network inside the computer’s memory – a sort of a virtual simulation of the corresponding real world scenario – so that a similar result can be achieved programmatically.</strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>Use an object called Main to represent your role in the scenario.</li>
              <li>As there is no physical writing involved, we can replace the Pen and Paper with an object called AgeList that is able to keep a list of ages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>{visual: optimizations: You → Main; Pen + Paper → AgeList}</p>

              <li>Adam: In the context of our ‘calculate average age’ example, the interface of Adam consists of requests that adam will respond to, e.g. “Give age to the nearest year, as at Jan 1st of this year” “State your name”; the implementation includes
                the mental calculation Adam uses to calculate the age which is not visible to other objects.</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Similarly, every object in the virtual world has an interface and an implementation.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adam: the interface might have a method getAge(Date asAt); the implementation of that method is not visible to other objects.</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>Objects interact by sending messages.</strong></p>
          <p>Both real world and virtual world object interactions can be viewed as objects sending message to each other. The message can result in the sender object receiving a response and/or the receiving object’s state being changed. Furthermore, the
            result can vary based on which object received the message, even if the message is identical.</p>

          <p>Writing an OOP program is essentially writing instructions that the computer uses to create the virtual world of object network and providing it the inputs to produce the outcome we want. It turns out sometimes multiple objects have the same
            behavior because they are of the same kind. Instructions for creating a one kind (or ‘class’) of objects can be done in one go and use that same instructions to instantiate (i.e. create) objects of that kind. We call such instructions a <em>Class</em>.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>When writing an OOP program to calculate the average age, instructions for creating objects Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy will be very similar because they are all of the same kind : they all represent ‘persons’ with same interface, same
              kind of data (i.e. name, DoB, etc.), and the same kind of behavior (i.e. getAge(Date), getName(), etc.). Therefore, we can have a class called Person containing instructions on how to create Person objects and use that class to instantiate
              objects Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy. Similarly, we need classes AgeList, Calculator, and Main classes to instantiate one each of AgeList, Calculator, and Main objects.</p>

          <p>While all objects of a class has the same attributes, each object has its own copy of the attribute value.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>All <code>Person</code> objects have the Name attribute but the value of that attribute varies between <code>Person</code> objects.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>However, some attributes are not suitable to be maintained by individual objects. Instead, they should be maintained centrally, shared by all objects of the class. They are like ‘global variables’ but attached to a specific class. Those are
            called <em>class level</em> attributes.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The attribute totalPersons should be maintained centrally and shared by all <code>Person</code> objects rather than copied at each <code>Person</code> object.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Similarly, when a normal method is being called, a message is being sent to the receiving object and the result may depend on the receiving object.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Sending the getName() message to Adam object results in the response “Adam” while sending the same message to the Beth object gets the response “Beth”.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>However, there can be methods related to a specific class but not suitable for sending message to a specific object of that class. Those are called class-level methods.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The method getTotalPersons() is not suitable to send to a specific <code>Person</code> object.</p>

          <p>Class-level attributes and methods are collectively called <em>class-level members</em> (also called <em>static members</em> sometimes because some programming languages use the keyword <code>static</code> to identify class-level members). They
            are to be accessed using the class name rather than an instance of the class.</p>

            have to duplicate code that is already implemented in the <code>Report</code> class. This can be achieved using the object-oriented concept of <em>inheritance</em>.</p>

          </tip-box>
          <p>In the example above, The <code>EvaluationReport</code> inherits the wordCount attribute and the print() method from the base class <code>Report</code>.</p>

          <p>Applying inheritance concept on a group of similar classes can result in the common parts among classes being extracted into more general classes. In the example below, <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code> behaves the same way for the ‘owes
            money’ association. However, the two classes cannot be simply replaced with a more general class <code>Person</code> because of the need to distinguish between <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code> for the ‘marriage’ association. A solution
            is to add the <code>Person</code> class as a super class and let <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code> inherit from <code>Person</code>.</p>

          <p>Inheritance implies the derived class can be considered as a <em>sub-type</em> of the base class (and the base class is a <em>super-type</em> of the derived class), resulting in an ‘is a’ relationship ; for example, in the class diagrams of
            a <em>Snakes and Ladders</em> board game given below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SnakeHeadSquare <em>is a</em> Square.</li>

          <p>Every instance of a subclass is an instance of the superclass, but not vice-versa. For example, an <code>Academic</code> is an instance of a <code>Staff</code>, but a <code>Staff</code> is not necessarily an instance of an <code>Academic</code>.
            As a result, inheritance allows <em>substitutability</em>. i.e. wherever an object of the superclass is expected, it can be substituted by an object of any of its subclasses. For example, the following code is valid because an <code>AcademicStaff</code>            object is substitutable as a <code>Staff</code> object.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>Staff staff = new AcademicStaff (); // OK
</code></pre>
          <p>But the following code is not because <code>staff</code> is declared as a <code>Staff</code> type (see above) and therefore its value may or may not be of type <code>AcademicStaff</code>, which is the type expected by variable <code>academicStaff</code>.</p>

          <p>Take the example of writing a payroll application for a university to facilitate payroll processing of university staff. Suppose an <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation adjusts the salaries of all staff members. This operation will be executed
            whenever the university initiates a salary adjustment for its staff. However, the adjustment formula is different for different staff categories, say admin and academic. Here is one possible way of designing the classes in the <code>Payroll</code>            system.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/oopDesign/polymorphism/introduction/images/payroll.png" height="150">
            <p></p>
            <p>Here is the implementation of the adjustSalary(int) operation from the above design.</p>
            <pre class="hljs"><code>class Payroll1 {
    ArrayList&lt; Admin &gt; admins;
    ArrayList&lt; Academic &gt; academics;
    // ...

    void adjustSalary(int byPercent) {
        for (Admin ad: admins) {
            ad.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
        for (Academic ac: academics) {
            ac.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Note how processing is similar for the two staff types. It is <strong>as if the type of staff members is irrelevant</strong> to how they are processed inside this operation! If that is the case, can the staff type be “abstracted away” from this
            operation? After all, why keep irrelevant details? Here is such an implementation of <code>adjustSalary(int)</code>:</p>
          <tip-box>
            <pre class="hljs"><code>class Payroll2 {
    ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt; staff;
    // ...

    void adjustSalary(int byPercent) {
        for (Staff s: staff) {
            s.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>Notice the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Only one data structure <code>ArrayList&lt;Staff&gt;</code>. It contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects but treats them as <code>Staff</code> objects</li>
              <li>Only one loop</li>
              <li>Outcome of the <code>s.adjustSalary(byPercent)</code> method call depends on whether <code>s</code> is an <code>Academic</code> or <code>Admin</code> object</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>The above code is better in several ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is shorter.</li>
            <li>It is simpler.</li>
            <li>It is more flexible (this code will remain the same even if more staff types are added).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This does not mean we are getting rid of the <code>Academic</code> and <code>Admin</code> classes completely and replacing them with a more general class called <code>Staff</code>. Rather, this part of the code “treats” both <code>Admin</code>            and <code>Academic</code> objects as one type called <code>Staff</code>.</p>
          <p>For example, <code>ArrayList</code> staff contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects although it treats all of them as <code>Staff</code> objects. However, when the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation of these objects
            is called, the resulting salary adjustment will be different for <code>Admin</code> objects and <code>Academic</code> objects. Therefore, <strong>different types of objects are treated as a single general type, but yet each type of object exhibits a different kind of behavior</strong>.
            This is called <em>polymorphism</em> (literally, it means “ability to take many forms”). In this example, an object that is perceived as type <code>Staff</code> can be an <code>Admin</code> object or an <code>Academic</code> object.</p>

          <p>There are three issues that are at the center of how polymorphism is achieved: <em>substitutability, operation overriding, and dynamic binding</em>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Substitutability: Because of substitutability, we can write code that expects object of a parent class and yet use that code with objects of child classes. That is how polymorphism is able to <em>treat objects of different types as one type</em>.</li>
            <li>Overriding: To get polymorphic behavior from an operation, the operation in the superclass needs to be overridden in each of the subclasses. That is how overriding allows objects of different sub classes to <em>display different behaviors in response to the same method call</em>.</li>
            <li>Dynamic binding: Overridden methods are bound to the method implementation dynamically during the runtime. That is how the code can call the method of the parent class and yet execute the implementation of the child class.</li>

            <p><code>newgame</code> and <code>clear x y</code> represent commands typed by the <code>Player</code> on the <code>TextUi</code>.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>How does the <code>TextUi</code> object carry out the requests it has received from player? It would need to interact with other objects of the system. Because the <code>Logic</code> class is the one that controls the game logic, the <code>TextUi</code>            needs to collaborate with <code>Logic</code> to fulfill the <code>newgame</code> request. Let us extend the model to capture that interaction.</p>

          <p>Now, let us look at what other objects and interactions are needed to support the <code>newGame()</code> operation. It is likely that a new <code>Minefield</code> object is created when the <code>newGame()</code> method is called.</p>

          <p>This interaction adds the following methods to the <code>Logic</code> class</p>

          </ul>
          <p>In the above design, <code>TextUi</code> does not access <code>Cell</code> objects directly. Instead, it gets values of type <code>CELL_APPEARANCE</code> from <code>Logic</code> to be displayed as a minefield to the player. Alternatively, each
            cell or the entire Minefield can be passed directly to <code>TextUi</code>.</p>

            <p>When designing components, it is not necessary to draw elaborate UML diagrams capturing all details of the design. They can be done as rough sketches. For example, draw sequence diagrams only when you are not sure which operations are required

          <p>b) <strong>To communicate</strong> information among stakeholders. Models can be used as a visual aid in discussions and documentations.</p>

            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>An architect can use an architecture diagram to explain the high-level design of the software to developers.</li>
              <li>A business analyst can use a use case diagram to explain to the customer the functionality of the system.</li>
              <li>A class diagram can be reverse-engineered from code so as to help explain the design of a component to a new developer.</li>

            <panel header="Model Driven Development :four:" type="seamless">
              <p><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploits models as blueprints. MDD uses models as primary engineering artifacts when developing
                software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can even involve manual translation from model
                to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to generate code from models and maintain the link between models
                and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise, but it is still an emerging technology</p>

            <p>--Ian Sommerville, in the book ‘Software Engineering’</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the problem domain (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). When used to model the problem domain, such class diagrams are called
            <strong><em>conceptual class diagrams</em></strong> or <strong><em>OO domain models (OODMs).</em></strong></p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example: OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
            <p>Description: Snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number
              of squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically
              move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p><img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingStructures/objectOrientedDomainModels/images/diagram.png" height="420">
            <p></p>
            <p>The above OO domain model omits the ladder class for simplicity. It can be included in a similar fashion to the Snake class.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not
            usually in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
          <p><strong>OODMs, just like a class diagram, represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem</strong> domain and not their behavior. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
          <p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but typically omit methods and navigability.</strong></p>

        <div>
          <p>State Machine Diagrams model state-dependent behavior.</p>
          <p>Consider how a CD player responds when the “eject CD” button is pushed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the CD tray is already open, it does nothing.</li>
            <li>If the CD tray is already in the process of opening (opened half-way), it continues to open the CD tray.</li>
            <li>If the CD tray is closed and the CD is being played, it stops playing and opens the CD tray.</li>
            <li>If the CD tray is closed and CD is not being played, it simply opens the CD tray.</li>
            <li>If the CD tray is already in the process of closing (closed half-way), it waits until the CD tray is fully closed and opens it immediately afterwards.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What this means is that the CD player’s response to pushing the “eject CD” button depends on what it was doing at the time of the event. More generally, the CD player’s response to the event received depends on its internal state. Such a behavior
            is called a <em>state-dependent behavior</em>.</p>
          <p>Often, state-dependent behavior displayed by an object in a system is simple enough that it needs no extra attention; such a behavior can be as simple as a ‘conditional’ behavior like ‘if x&gt;y, then x=x-y’. Occasionally, objects may exhibit
            state-dependent behavior that is deemed too complex such that it needs to be captured into a separate model. Such state-dependent behavior can be modelled using UML <em>state machine diagrams</em> (SMD for short, sometimes also called ‘state
            charts’, ‘state diagrams’ or ‘state machines’).</p>
          <p>An SMD views the life-cycle of an object as consisting of a finite number of states where each state displays a unique behavior pattern. An SMD captures information such as the states an object can be in, during its lifetime, and how the object
            responds to various events while in each state and how the object transits from one state to another. In contrast to sequence diagrams that capture object behavior one scenario at a time, SMDs capture the object’s behavior over its full life
            cycle. Given below is an example SMD for the Minesweeper game. More details on SMDs can be found in the appendix of this handout.</p>

            <p>“The software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them. Architecture
              is concerned with the public side of interfaces; private details of elements—details having to do solely with internal implementation—are not architectural.”</p>
            <p>-- <em>Software Architecture in Practice (2nd edition)</em>, Bass, Clements, and Kazman</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The software architecture shows the overall organization of the system and can be viewed as a very high-level design. It usually consists of a set of interacting components that fit together to achieve the required functionality. It should be
            a simple and technically viable structure that is well-understood and agreed-upon by everyone in the development team, and it forms the basis for the implementation.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>The high-level components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GUI: Graphical user interface</li>
              <li>TextUi: Textual user interface</li>

          <p>The architecture is typically designed by the <em>software architect</em>, who provides the technical vision of the system and makes high-level (i.e. architecture-level) technical decisions on the project.</p>

            <p>Examples: the logical view (satisfying the functional requirements) vs. the process view (concurrency issues) vs. the physical view (distribution issues) vs. the development view (how the design is broken down into implementation units with
              explicit representation of the dependencies among the units).</p>

          <p>The <em>service-oriented architecture</em> (SOA) is a relatively recent architectural style for distributed applications. An SOA is essentially an application built by combining functionalities packaged as <strong>programmatically accessible services</strong>.
            A prerequisite for SOA is the interoperability between distributed services, which may not even be implemented using the same programming language. A common way to implement SOAs is through the use of <em>XML web services</em> where the web
            is used as the medium for the services to interact, and XML is used as the language of communication between service providers and service users.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Suppose that <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> provides a web service for customers to browse and buy merchandize, while HSBC provides a web service for merchants to charge HSBC credit cards. Using these web services, an ‘eBookShop’
              web application can be developed that allows HSBC customers to buy merchandize from Amazon and pay for them using HSBC credit cards. Since both Amazon and HSBC services follow the SOA architecture, their web services can be reused by the
              web application, even if all three systems use different programming platforms.</p><img src="/se-book/architecture/architecturalStyles/serviceOriented/what/images/amazonWebServices.png" height="280">

          <p>An event is a notable occurrence that happens inside or outside the software, such as the user clicking a button, a timer running out, minimizing a window, etc. In the event-driven architectural style, events are detected and communicated to
            the affected components. These components then react to the events, if required. For example, when the ‘button clicked’ event occurs, functions that are tied to the button-click event is activated. This architectural style is often used in
            GUIs.</p>

          <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
          <p>A certain classes should have no more than just one instance (e.g. the main controller class of the system). These single instances are commonly known as <em>singletons</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>A normal class can be instantiated multiple times by invoking the constructor.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
          <p>The key insight of the solution is that the <em>constructor</em> of the singleton class cannot be <em>public</em>. Because a <em>public constructor</em> will allow others to instantiate the class at will, a <em>private constructor</em> should
            be used instead. In addition, a public class-level method is provided to access the <em>single instance</em>.</p>

        <div>
          <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
          <p>There is a group of similar entities that appears to be ‘occurrences’ (or ‘copies’) of the same thing, sharing lots of common information, but also differing in significant ways.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>In a library, there can be multiple copies of same book title. Each copy shares common information such as book title, author, ISBN etc. However, there are also significant differences like purchase date and barcode number (assumed to be unique
              for each copy of the book).</p>
            <p>Other examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Episodes of the same TV series</li>
              <li>Stock items of the same product model (e.g. TV sets of the same model).</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>Representing the objects mentioned previously as a single class would be problematic because it results in duplication of data which can lead to inconsistencies in data (if some of the duplicates are not updated consistently).</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Take for example the problem of representing books in a library. Assume that there could be multiple copies of the same title, bearing the same ISBN number, but different serial numbers.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/book.png"
              height="200">
            <p></p>
            <p>The above solution requires common information to be duplicated by all instances. This will not only waste storage space, but also creates a consistency problem. Suppose that after creating several copies of the same title, the librarian realized
              that the author name was wrongly spelt. To correct this mistake, the system needs to go through every copy of the same title to make the correction. Also, if a new copy of the title is added later on, the librarian has to make sure that
              all information entered is the same as the existing copies to avoid inconsistency.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>Anti-pattern</strong></p>
          <p>Refer to the same Library example given above.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookFriends.png" height="240">
            <p></p>
            <p>The design above segregates the common and unique information into a class hierarchy. Each book title is represented by a separate class with common data (i.e. Name, Author, ISBN) hard-coded in the class itself. This solution is problematic
              because each book title is represented as a class, resulting in thousands of classes (one for each title). Every time the library buys new books, the source code of the system will have to be updated with new classes.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
          <p>Let a book copy be represented by two objects instead of one, as given below.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookTitleBookCopy.png" height="240">
            <p></p>
            <p>In this solution, the common and unique information are separated into two classes to avoid duplication. Given below is another example that contrasts the two situations before and after applying the pattern.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/beforeAfter.png"

          <p>The general idea can be found in the following class diagram:</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/abstractionOccurrence.png" height="50">
          <p></p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Abstraction &gt;&gt;</code> class should hold all common information, and the unique information should be kept by the <code>&lt;&lt; Occurrence &gt;&gt;</code> class. Note that ‘Abstraction’ and ‘Occurrence’ are not class
            names, but roles played by each class. Think of this diagram as a <em>meta-model</em> (i.e. a ‘model of a model’) of the <code>BookTitle-BookCopy</code> class diagram given above.</p>

          <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
          <p>Components need to access functionality deep inside other components. For example, the <code>UI</code> component of a <code>Library</code> system might want to access functionality of the <code>Book</code> class contained inside the <code>Logic</code>            component.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/facade/what/images/textBook.png" height="120">
            <p></p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>Access to the component should be allowed without exposing its internal details. For example, the <code>UI</code> component should access the functionality of the <code>Logic</code> component without knowing that it contained a <code>Book</code>            class within it.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
          <p>Include a Façade class that sits between the component internals and users of the component such that all access to the component happens through the Façade class. The following class diagram shows the application of the Façade pattern to the
            <code>Library System</code> example. In this example, the <code>LibraryLogic</code> class acts as the Façade class.</p>

          <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
          <p>A system is required to execute a number of commands, each doing a different task. For example, a system might have to support <code>Sort</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Reset</code> commands.</p>
          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>It is preferable that some part of the code execute these commands without having to know each command type. For example, there can be a <code>CommandQueue</code> object that is responsible for queuing commands and executing them without knowledge
            of what each command does.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
          <p>In the example solution below, the <code>CommandCreator</code> creates <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset Command</code> objects and adds them to the <code>CommandQueue</code> object. The <code>CommandQueue</code> object treats
            them all as <code>Command</code> objects and performs the execute/undo operation on each of them without knowledge of the specific <code>Command</code> type. When executed, each <code>Command</code> object will access the <code>DataStore</code>            object to carry out its task. The <code>Command</code> class can also be an abstract class or an interface.</p>

          <p>The general form of the solution is as follows.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/command/what/images/clientInvoker.png" height="200">
          <p></p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Client &gt;&gt;</code> creates a <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> object, and passes it to the <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code> object treats all commands as
            a general <code>&lt;&lt; Command &gt;&gt;</code> type. <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code> issues a request by calling <code>execute()</code> on the command. If a command is undoable, <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> will
            store the state for undoing the command prior to invoking <code>execute()</code>. In addition, the <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> object may have to be linked to any <code>&lt;&lt; Receiver &gt;&gt;</code> of the command before
            it is passed to the <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code>. Note that an application of the command pattern does not have to follow the structure given above. The essential element is to have a general <code>&lt;&lt; Command &gt;&gt;</code>            object that can be passed around, stored, executed, etc</p>

          <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
          <p>Most applications support storage/retrieval of information, displaying of information to the user (often via multiple UIs having different formats), and changing stored information based on external inputs.</p>
          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>To reduce coupling resulting from the interlinked nature of the features described above.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
          <p>To decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by separating them into three different components: Model, View and Controller.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>View: Displays data, interacts with the user, and pulls data from the model if necessary.</li>
            <li>Controller: Detects UI events such as mouse clicks, button pushes and takes follow up action. Updates/changes the model/view when necessary.</li>
            <li>Model: Stores and maintains data. Updates views if necessary.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The relationship between the components can be observed in the diagram below. Typically, the UI is the combination of view and controller.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/modelViewController/what/images/classDiagram.png" height="150">
            <p></p>
            <p>Given below is a concrete example of MVC applied to a student management system. In this scenario, the user is retrieving data of one student.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/modelViewController/what/images/sequenceDiagram.png" height="220">
            <p></p>
            <p>In the diagram above, when the user clicks on a button using the UI, the ‘click’ event is caught and handled by the <code>UiController</code>.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Note that in a simple UI where there’s only one view, Controller and View can be combined as one class.</p>
          <p>There are many variations of the MVC model used in different domains. For example, the one used in a desktop GUI could be different from the one used in a Web application.</p>

          <p>Here is another scenario from the same student management system where the user is adding a new student to the system.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/sequenceDiagram.png" height="300">
            <p></p>
            <p>Now, assume the system has two additional views used in parallel by different users:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>StudentListUi</code>: that accesses a list of students and</li>
              <li><code>StudentStatsUi</code>: that generates statistics of current students.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When a student is added to the database using <code>NewStudentUi</code> shown above, both <code>StudentListUi</code> and <code>StudentStatsUi</code> should get updated automatically, as shown below.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/studentListUI.png"
              height="150">
            <p></p>
            <p>However, the <code>StudentList</code> object has no knowledge about <code>StudentListUi</code> and <code>StudentStatsUi</code> (note the direction of the navigability) and has no way to inform those objects. This is an example of the type
              of problem addressed by the Observer pattern.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
          <p>An object (possibly, more than one) is interested to get notified when a change happens to another object. That is, some objects want to ‘observe’ another object.</p>
          <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
          <p>A bidirectional link between the two objects is not desirable. However the two entities need to communicate with each other. That is, the ‘observed’ object does not want to be coupled to objects that are ‘observing’ it.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
          <p>The Observer pattern shows us how an object can communicate with other objects while avoiding a direct coupling with them. The solution is to force the communication through an interface known to both parties. A concrete example is given below.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/studentListObserver.png" height="130">

            <p>During initialization of the system,</p>
            <ol>

StudentListUi listUi = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> StudentListUi();
StudentStatusUi statusUi = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> StudentStatsUi();
</code></pre>
            <ol start="2">
              <li>Next, the two UIs indicate to the <code>StudentList</code> that they are interested in being updated whenever <code>StudentList</code> changes. This is also known as ‘subscribing for updates’.</li>
            </ol>
            <pre><code class="hljs java">studentList.addUi(listUi);
studentList.addUi(statusUi);
</code></pre>
            <p>Within the <code>addUi</code> operation of <code>StudentList</code>, all Observer objects subscribers are added to an internal data structure called <code>observerList</code>.</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-comment">//StudentList class</span>

    observerList.add(o);
}
</code></pre>
            <p>As such, whenever the data in <code>StudentList</code> changes (e.g. when a new student is added to the <code>StudentList</code>), all interested observers are updated by calling the <code>notifyUIs</code> operation.</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-comment">//StudentList class</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">notifyUIs</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

        o.update();
}
</code></pre>
            <p>UIs can then pull data from the <code>StudentList</code> whenever the <code>update</code> operation is called.</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-comment">//StudentListUI class</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">update</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">//refresh UI by pulling data from StudentList</span>
}
</code></pre>
            <p>Note that StudentList is unaware of the exact nature of the two UIs but still manages to communicate with them via an intermediary.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Here is the generic description of the observer pattern:</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/observableInterfaceDiagram.png" height="80">
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> is an interface: any class that implements it can observe an <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code>. Any number of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> objects can observe (i.e. listen to changes
              of) the <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code> object.</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code> maintains a list of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> objects. <code>addObserver(Observer)</code> operation adds a new <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> to the list of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;s</code>.</li>
            <li>Whenever there is a change in the <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code>, the <code>notifyObservers()</code> operation is called that will call the <code>update()</code> operation of all <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;s</code> in the list.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In a GUI application, how is the Controller notified when the “save” button is clicked? UI frameworks such as JavaFX has inbuilt support for the Observer pattern.</p>

          <p>Let us look at a case study that shows how design patterns are used in the design of a class structure for a Stock Inventory System (SIS) for a shop. The shop sells appliances, and accessories for the appliances. SIS simply stores information
            about each item in the store.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p><strong>Use Cases</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a new item</li>
              <li>View information about an item</li>
              <li>Modify information about an item</li>
              <li>View all available accessories for a given appliance</li>
              <li>List all items in the store</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
          <p>SIS can be accessed using multiple terminals. Shop assistants use their own terminals to access SIS, while the shop manager’s terminal continuously displays a list of all items in store. In the future, it is expected that suppliers of items
            use their own applications to connect to SIS to get real-time information about current stock status. User authentication is not required for the current version, but may be required in the future.</p>
          <p>A step by step explanation of the design is given below. Note that this is one out of many possible designs. Design patterns are also applied where appropriate.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>A <code>StockItem</code> can be an Appliance or an Accessory.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItem.png" height="100">
            <p></p>
            <p>To track that each <code>Accessory</code> is associated with the correct <code>Appliance</code>, consider the following alternative class structures.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeOne.png"
              height="120">
            <p></p>
            <p>The third one seems more appropriate (the second one is suitable if accessories can have accessories). Next, consider between keeping a list of <code>Appliances</code>, and a list of <code>StockItems</code>. Which is more appropriate?</p>
            <img
              src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeTwo.png" height="100">
              <p></p>
              <p>The latter seems more suitable because it can handle both appliances and accessories the same way. Next, an abstraction occurrence pattern is applied to keep track of <code>StockItems</code>.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeThree.png"
                height="100">
              <p></p>
              <p>Note the inclusion of navigabilities. Here’s a sample object diagram based on the class model created thus far.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItemListObjectDiagram.png" height="150">
              <p></p>
              <p>Next, apply the façade pattern to shield the SIS internals from the UI.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withFacade.png" height="200">
              <p></p>
              <p>As UI consists of multiple views, the MVC pattern is applied here.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withMVC.png" height="270">
              <p></p>
              <p>Some views need to be updated when the data change; apply the Observer pattern here.</p><img src="/se-book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withObserver.png" height="270">
              <p></p>
              <p>In addition, the Singleton pattern can be applied to the façade class.</p>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral</strong>: Defining how objects interact and how responsibility is distributed among them.
              <ul>
                <li>Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Template Method, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor</li>

          <p>{patterns provide a vocabulary}</p>
          <p>The more patterns one acquires, the more ‘experienced’ she is. Exposing oneself to a multitude of patterns (at least the context and problem) is a must. Some patterns are domain-specific (e.g. patterns for distributed applications), some are
            created in-house (e.g. patterns in the company/project) and some can be self-created (e.g. from past experience).</p>
          <p>When using patterns, be careful not to overuse them. Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they are needed.
            Before applying a pattern, make sure that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>there is substantial improvement in the design, not just superficial.</li>
            <li>the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).</li>

        <div>
          <p>The notion of capturing design ideas as &quot;patterns&quot; is usually attributed to Christopher Alexander. He is a building architect noted for his theories about design. His book <em>Timeless way of building</em> talks about “design patterns”
            for constructing buildings.</p>
          <p>Here is a sample pattern from that book:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>When a room has a window with a view, the window becomes a focal point: people are attracted to the window and want to look through it. The furniture in the room creates a second focal point: everyone is attracted toward whatever point the
              furniture aims them at (usually the center of the room or a TV). This makes people feel uncomfortable. They want to look out the window, and toward the other focus at the same time. If you rearrange the furniture, so that its focal point
              becomes the window, then everyone will suddenly notice that the room is much more “comfortable”</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Apparently, patterns and anti-patterns are found in the field of building architecture. This is because they are general concepts applicable to any domain, not just software design. In software engineering, there are many general types of patterns:
            Analysis patterns, Design patterns, Testing patterns, Architectural patterns, Project management patterns, and so on.</p>
          <p>In fact, the abstraction occurrence pattern is more of an analysis pattern than a design pattern, while MVC is more of an architectural pattern.</p>
          <p>New patterns can be created too. If a common problem needs to be solved frequently that leads to a non-obvious and better solution, it can be formulated as a pattern so that it can be reused by others. However, don’t reinvent the wheel; the
            pattern might already exist.</p>

          <p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.</strong></p>
          <p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
            <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
            <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
            <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>

            <p>Note: Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
                This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
                <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
                <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than a 'quick try') due to these reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique. If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</p>

                <ul>

                  <li>Use parentheses/braces to show grouping even when they can be skipped.</li>
                  <li>Use enumerations when a certain variable can take only a small number of finite values. For example, instead of declaring the variable 'state' as an integer and using values 0,1,2 to denote the states 'starting', 'enabled', and 'disabled'
                    respectively, declare 'state' as type <code>SystemState</code> and define an enumeration <code>SystemState</code> that has values <code>'STARTING'</code>, <code>'ENABLED'</code>, and <code>'DISABLED'</code>.</li>
                  <li>When statements should follow a particular order, try to make it obvious (with appropriate naming, or at least comments). For example, if you name two functions <code>'taskA()'</code> and <code>'taskB()'</code>, it is not obvious which
                    one should be called first. Contrast this with naming the functions <code>'phaseOne()'</code> and <code>'phaseTwo()'</code> instead. This is especially important when statements in one function must be called before the other one.</li>

                    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong>:</p>
                    <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only
                      details that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand. For example, within a certain software component, we might deal with a ‘user’ data type, while ignoring the details contained in the user data item. These
                      details have been ‘abstracted away’ as they do not affect the task of that software component. This is called <em>data abstraction</em>. On the other hand, <em>control abstraction</em> abstracts away details of the actual control
                      flow to focus on tasks at a simplified level. For example, <code>print(“Hello”)</code> is an abstraction of the actual output mechanism within the computer.</p>
                    <p>Abstraction can be applied repeatedly to obtain higher and <em>higher levels of abstractions</em>. For example, a <code>File</code> is a data item that is at a higher level than an array and an array is at a higher level than a bit.
                      Similarly, <code>execute(Game)</code> is at a higher level than <code>print(Char)</code> which is at a higher than an Assembly language instruction <code>MOV</code>.</p>

            closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally consistent
            with typical industry practices. Doing so will make it easier for others to work with your code, be they members from the same team or transferred from another team/company.</p>

                <p><strong>Define variables in the least possible scope</strong>. For example, if the variable is used only within the <code>if</code> block of the conditional statement, it should be declared inside that <code>if</code> block.</p>

          <p>The first version of the code you write may not be of production quality. It is acceptable to first concentrate on making the code work, rather than worry over the quality of the code, as long as you improve the quality later. This process of
            <strong>improving a program's internal structure in small steps without modifying its external behavior is called <em>refactoring</em>.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Refactoring is not rewriting</strong>: Discarding poorly-written code entirely and re-writing it from scratch is not refactoring because refactoring needs to be done in small steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Refactoring is not bug fixing</strong>: By definition, refactoring is different from bug fixing or any other modifications that alter the external behavior (e.g. adding a feature) of the component in concern.</li>

              <li>improve performance (sometimes, simpler code runs faster than complex code because simpler code is easier for the compiler to optimize).</li>

          <p>Developer-to-developer documentation can be in one of two forms:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Documentation for <em>developer-as-user</em>: Software components are written by developers and used by other developers. Therefore, there is a need to document how the components are to be used. API documents form the bulk of this category.
                Writing documentation of the first kind is easier because a component with a well-defined API exposes functionality in small-sized, independent and easy-to-use chunks. Examples of such documentation can be found in the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">Java API</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Documentation for <em>developer-as-maintainer</em>: There is a need to document how a system or a component is designed, implemented and tested so that other developers can maintain and evolve the code. Writing documentation of the second
                type is harder because of the need to explain complex internal details of a non-trivial system.</p>

          <p>When writing project documents, a top-down breadth-first explanation is easier to understand than a bottom-up one. To explain a system called <em>SystemFoo</em> with two sub-systems, <em>front-end</em> and <em>back-end</em>, start by describing
            the system at the highest level of abstraction, and progressively drill down to lower level details. An outline for such a description is given below.</p>
          <p>[First, explain what the system is, in a black-box fashion (no internal details, only the external view).]
            <em>SystemFoo</em> is a ....</p>
          <p>[Next, explain the high-level architecture of <em>SystemFoo</em>, referring to its major components only.]
            <em>SystemFoo</em> consists of two major components: <em>front-end</em> and <em>back-end</em>. The job of <em>front-end</em> is to ... while the job of <em>back-end</em> is to ... And this is how <em>front-end</em> and <em>back-end</em> work
            together ...</p>
          <p>[Now we can drill down to <em>front-end</em>'s details.]
            <em>front-end</em> consists of three major components: A, B, C A's job is to ... B's job is to... C's job is to... And this is how the three components work together ...</p>
          <p>[At this point, further drill down the internal workings of each component. A reader who is not interested in knowing nitty-gritty details can skip ahead to the section on <em>back-end</em>.] ...

          <p>Here are some tips on writing effective documentation.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use plenty of diagrams: It is not enough to explain something in words; complement it with visual illustrations (e.g. a UML diagram).</li>
            <li>Use plenty of examples: When explaining algorithms, show a running example to illustrate each step of the algorithm, in parallel to worded explanations.</li>
            <li>Use simple and direct explanations: Convoluted explanations and fancy words will annoy readers. Avoid long sentences.</li>
            <li>Get rid of statements that do not add value. For example, 'We made sure our system works perfectly' (who didn't?), 'Component X has its own responsibilities' (of course it has!).</li>
            <li>It is not a good idea to have separate sections for each type of artifact, such as 'use cases', 'sequence diagrams', 'activity diagrams', etc. Such a structure, coupled with the mindless inclusion of diagrams without justifying their need,
              indicates a failure to understand the purpose of documentation. Include diagrams when they are needed to explain the system. If it is a must to provide a comprehensive collection of diagrams, include them in the appendix as a reference.</li>

          <p>However, the code segment that encountered the unusual situation might not know how to recover from it. That is why most languages allow a method to encapsulate the unusual situation in an Exception object and ‘throw’ that object so that another
            piece of code can ‘catch’ it and deal with it. Usually, an exception thrown by a method is caught by the caller method. If the called method does not know how to deal with the exception it caught, it will throw the Exception object to its
            own caller. If none of the callers is prepared to deal with the exception, the exceptions can propagate through the method call stack until it is received by the main method and thrown to the runtime, thus halting the system. In the Java code
            given below, <code>processArray</code> can potentially throw an <code>InvalidInputException</code>. Because of that, <code>processInput</code> method invokes <code>processArray</code> method inside a <code>try{ }</code> block and has a <code>catch{ }</code>            block to specify what to do if the exception is actually thrown.</p>

          <p>Assertions are <strong>used to confirm assumptions about the program state</strong>. An assertion can be used to express something like ‘when the execution comes to this point, the variable v cannot be null’. This implies that if v is null at
            that point, the code has a bug. If the runtime detects such an ‘assertion failure’ (think of it as an ‘assumption violation), the runtime will typically take some drastic action such as terminating the execution with an error message. This
            is because an assertion failure is a confirmation of the code having a bug and the sooner the execution stops, the safer it is.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> timeout = Config.getTimeout(); <span class="hljs-comment">// line 1</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">assert</span> timeout &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// line 2</span>
setTimeout(timeout); <span class="hljs-comment">// line 3</span>
</code></pre>
            <p>In the Java code given above, the assertion in line 2 verifies the assumption that <code>timeout</code> returned by <code>Config.getTimeout()</code> is greater than 0. The only reason for it to return a zero or lower value in line 1 is the
              presence of a bug in the system.</p>

              <li>The assertions mentioned above have a different purpose from the Assertions used in unit testing frameworks such as JUnit. Unit testing assertions are located outside the functional program and used for explicit testing of the program before

              <li>Some runtime environments disable assertions by default. This could create a situation where the developer thinks all assertions are being verified as true while in fact they are not being verified at all. Therefore, remember to enable assertions
                when you run the program if you want them to be in effect.</li>

          <p>While it is relatively easy to implement a customized logging system (e.g. by inserting file I/O statements to write to a log file), most programming environments come with logging systems that allow more sophisticated forms of logging. For
            example, being able to enable and disable logging easily or to change the logging intensity/verbosity (i.e. how much information to record).</p>
          <p>Given below is a sample Java code that uses Java’s default logging mechanism. When running the code, the logging level can be set to WARNING so that log messages specified as INFO level will not be written to the log file at all.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>How critical is the reliability of the system?</li>
            <li>Will the code be used by programmers other than the author?</li>

          <p>Suppose an operation is implemented with the behavior specified precisely in the API (preconditions, post conditions, exceptions etc.). When following the defensive approach, the code should first check if the preconditions have been met. Typically,
            exceptions are thrown if preconditions are violated. In contrast, the <em>Design-by-Contract (DbC)</em> approach to coding assumes that it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure all preconditions are met. The operation will honor the
            contract only if the preconditions have been met. If any of them have not been met, the behavior of the operation is “unspecified”.</p>
          <p>Languages such as Eiffel have native support for DbC. For example, preconditions of an operation can be specified in Eiffel and the language runtime will check precondition violations without the need to do it explicitly in the code. To follow
            the DbC approach in languages such as Java and C++ where there is no built-in DbC support, assertions can be used to confirm pre-conditions.</p>

          <p>In terms of timing and frequency, there are two general approaches to integration:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><em>Late and one-time</em>: In an extreme case of this approach, developers wait till all components are completed and integrate all finished components just before the release. This approach is not recommended because integration often causes
              many component incompatibilities (due to previous miscommunications and misunderstandings) to surface which can lead to delivery delays: Late integration → incompatibilities found → major rework required → cannot meet the delivery date.</li>
            <li><em>Early and frequent</em>: The other approach is to integrate early and evolve in parallel in small steps, re-integrating frequently. For example, a working skeleton can be written first (i.e. it compiles and runs but does not produce any
              useful output). This can be done by one developer, possibly the one in charge of integration. After that, all developers can flesh out the skeleton in parallel, adding one feature at a time. After each feature is done, simply integrate the
              new code to the main system.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Whether using frequent integration or one-time late integration, there is still a need to decide the order in which components are to be integrated. There are several approaches to doing this, as explained next.</p>

          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Top-down</em> integration: In top-down integration, higher-level components are integrated before bringing in the lower-level components. One advantage of this approach is that higher-level problems can be discovered early. One disadvantage
              is that this requires the use of dummy or skeletal components (i.e. stubs) in place of lower level components until the real lower-level components are integrated to the system. Otherwise, higher-level components cannot function as they
              depend on lower level ones.</li>
            <li><em>Bottom-up</em> integration: This is the reverse of top-down integration. Advantages and disadvantages are simply the reverse of those of the top-down approach.</li>
            <li><em>Sandwich</em> integration: This is a mix of the top-down and the bottom-up approaches. The idea is to do both top-down and bottom-up so as to “meet up” in the middle.</li>

        <div>
          <p>In a non-trivial project, building a product from source code can be a complex multi-step process. For example, it can include steps such as to pull code from the revision control system, compile, link, run automated tests, automatically update
            release documents (e.g. build number), package into a distributable, push to repo, deploy to a server, delete temporary files created during building/testing, email developers of the new build, and so on. Furthermore, this build process can
            be done ‘on demand’, it can be scheduled (e.g. every day at midnight) or it can be triggered by various events (e.g. triggered by a code push to the revision control system).</p>
          <p>Some of these build steps such as to compile, link and package are already automated in most modern IDEs. For example, several steps happen automatically when the ‘build’ button of the IDE is clicked. Some IDEs even allow customization to this
            build process to some extent.</p>
          <p>However, most big projects use specialized build tools to automate complex build processes.</p>
          <p>Build tool examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Modern software projects often depend on third party libraries that evolve constantly. That means developers need to download the correct version of the required libraries and update them regularly. Therefore, dependency management is an important
            part of build automation. <em>Dependency Management</em> tools can automate that aspect of a project. Maven and Gradle, in addition to managing the build process, can play the role of dependency management tools too.</p>

          <p>An extreme application of build automation is called <em>continuous integration (CI)</em> in which integration, building, and testing happens automatically after each code change. A natural extension of CI is <em>Continuous Deployment (CD)</em>            where the changes are not only integrated continuously, but also deployed to end-users at the same time.</p>

        <div>
          <p>When implementing inheritance, we should take care to preserve substitutability: i.e. the ability of sub-class objects to be substituted where a super class object is expected. In other words, we should follow the Liskov Substitution Principle.
            In concrete terms it means a subclass must honor the contract set by the super class.</p>
          <p>A classic example of violating substitutability is given below.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/oopImplementation/substitutability/images/rectangleSquare.png" height="120">
            <p></p>
            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Rectangle</span> </span>{
    Rectangle(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> height, <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> width){
        …
    }
}
<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Square</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title">Rectangle</span> </span>{
    Square(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> height, <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> width){
        <span class="hljs-keyword">super</span>(height, width);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (height != width) {
            <span class="hljs-comment">//error</span>
       }
    }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>Explanation: The <code>super</code> class constructor can take any integers for height and width. This contract is violated by <code>Square</code> class because it does not accept a height that is different from the width. This means code
              that is written to work with <code>Rectangle</code> class might fail in unexpected ways when it is given <code>Square</code> objects instead of <code>Rectangle</code> objects. That is, <code>Square</code> class is not substitutable for the
              <code>Rectangle</code> class.</p>

          <p>An <em>Application Programming Interface (API)</em> specifies the interface through which other programs can interact with a software component. It is a contract between the component and its clients.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The API of the Java String class is given at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html</a></p>
            <p>In this case, the API is a collection of public methods that we can invoke to make use of the String class.</p>

            <p>In this case the API is a collection of Web request formats GitHub server accepts and the corresponding responses. We can write a program that interacts with GitHub through that API.</p>

          <p>An API should be well-designed (i.e. should cater for the needs of its users) and well-documented.</p>
          <p>When we write software consisting of multiple components, we need to define the API of each component.</p>
          <p>One approach is to let the API emerge and evolve over time as we write code.</p>
          <p>Another approach is to define the API up-front. Doing so allows us to develop the components in parallel.</p>
          <p>We can use UML <em>sequence diagrams</em> to analyze the required interactions between components in order to discover the required API. Given below is an example.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/reuse/apis/designingAPIs/images/textLogic.png" height="500">
            <p></p>
            <p>As we analyze the interactions between components using sequence diagrams, we discover the API of those components. For example, the diagram above tells us that the MSLogic component API should have the methods:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>new()</code></li>
              <li><code>getWidth:int</code></li>
              <li><code>getHeight():int</code></li>
              <li><code>getRemainingMineCount():int</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>More details can be included to increase the precision of the method definitions before coding. Such precision is important to avoid misunderstandings between the developer of the class and developers of other classes that interact with this
              class.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Operation</strong>: <em>newGame(): void</em></li>
              <li><strong>Description</strong>: Generates a new <em>WxH</em> minefield with <em>M</em> mines. Any existing minefield will be overwritten.</li>
              <li><strong>Preconditions</strong>: None</li>
              <li><strong>Postconditions</strong>: A new minefield is created. Game state is READY.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Preconditions are the conditions that must be true before calling this operation. Postconditions describe the system after the operation is complete. Note that post conditions do not say what happens during the operation. Here is another example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Operation</strong>: <em>clearCellAt(int x, int y): void</em></li>
              <li><strong>Description</strong>: Records the cell at x,y as cleared.</li>
              <li><strong>Parameters</strong>: x, y coordinates of the cell</li>
              <li><strong>Preconditions</strong>: game state is READY or IN_PLAY. x and y are in 0..(H-1) and 0..(W-1), respectively.</li>
              <li><strong>Postconditions</strong>: Cell at x,y changes state to ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE, …, EIGHT, or INCORRECTLY_CLEARED. Game state changes to IN_PLAY, WON or LOST as appropriate.</li>

          <p>A <em>platform</em> provides a runtime environment for applications. A platform is often bundled with various libraries, tools, frameworks, and technologies in addition to a runtime environment but the defining characteristic of a software platform
            is the presence of a runtime environment.</p>
          <p>Technically, an operating system can be called a platform. For example, Windows PC is a platform for desktop applications while iOS is a platform for mobile apps.</p>
          <p>Two well-known examples of platforms are JavaEE and .NET, both of which sit above Operating systems layer, and are used to develop <em>enterprise applications</em>. Infrastructure services such as connection pooling, load balancing, remote code
            execution, transaction management, authentication, security, messaging etc. are done similarly in most
            <trigger for="modal:enterprise-application" trigger="click">enterprise applications</trigger>. Both JavaEE and .NET provide these services to applications in a customizable way without developers having to implement them from scratch every time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition) is both a framework and a platform for writing enterprise applications. The runtime used by the JavaEE applications is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that can run on different Operating Systems.</li>
            <li>.NET is a similar platform and a framework. Its runtime is called CLR (Common Language Runtime) and usually used on Windows machines.</li>

          <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over the network, rather than a product running on a local machine. This means the actual hardware and software is located at a remote location, typically, at a large server farm, while
            users access them over the network. Maintenance of the hardware and software is managed by the cloud provider while users typically pay for only the amount of services they use. This model is similar to the consumption of electricity; the
            power company manages the power plant, while the consumers pay them only for the electricity used. The cloud computing model optimizes hardware and software utilization and reduces the cost to consumers. Furthermore, users can scale up/down
            their utilization at will without having to upgrade their hardware and software. The traditional non-cloud model of computing is similar to everyone buying their own generators to create electricity for their own use.</p>

          <p>Cloud computing can deliver computing services at three levels:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</strong>: IaaS delivers computer infrastructure as a service. For example, a user can deploy virtual servers on the cloud instead of buying physical hardware and installing server software on them.
                Another example would be a customer using storage space on the cloud for off-site storage of data. Rackspace is an example of an IaaS cloud provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is another one.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS)</strong>: PaaS provides a platform on which developers can build applications. Developers do not have to worry about infrastructure issues such as deploying servers or load balancing as is required when
                using IaaS. Those aspects are automatically taken care of by the platform. The price to pay is reduced flexibility; applications written on PaaS are limited to facilities provided by the platform. A PaaS example is the Google App Engine
                where developers can build applications using Java, Python, PHP, or Go whereas Amazon EC2 allows users to deploy application written in any language on their virtual servers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Software as a service (SaaS)</strong>: This is when applications can be accessed over the network instead of installing them on a local machine. For example, Google Docs is an SaaS word processing software, while Microsoft Word is

            <li>Building the right system, i.e. are the requirements correct? This is called <em>validation</em>.</li>
            <li>Building the system right, i.e. are the requirements implemented correctly? This is called <em>verification</em>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is both are done, instead of limiting to verification (i.e., remember that the requirements can be wrong too).</p>

          <p>Code review is the systematic examination code with the intention of finding where the code can be improved.</p>
          <p>Reviews can be done in various forms. Some examples below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>In pair programming</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>As pair programming involves two programmers working on the same code at the same time, there is an implicit review of the code by the other member of the pair.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Pull Request reviews</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tools such as GitHub and BitBucket allows the new code to be proposed as Pull Requests and provides the ability for others to review the code in the PR.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Inspections involve a group of people systematically examining a project artefact to discover defects. Members of the inspection team play various roles during the process, such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>the author - the creator of the artefact</li>
                    <li>the moderator - the planner and executer of the inspection meeting</li>
                    <li>the secretary - the recorder of the findings of the inspection</li>
                    <li>the inspector/reviewer - the one who inspects/reviews the artefact.</li>

              </ul>
            </li>

          <p><strong>When testing, we execute a set of <em>test cases</em>.</strong> A test case specifies how to perform a test. At a minimum, it specifies the input to the <em>software under test (SUT)</em> and the expected behavior.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Example: A minimal test case for testing a browser:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Input</strong> – Start the browser using a blank page (vertical scrollbar disabled). Then, load <code>longfile.html</code> located in the <code>test data</code> folder.</li>
              <li><strong>Expected behavior</strong> – The scrollbar should be automatically enabled upon loading <code>longfile.html</code>.</li>
            </ul>
          </tip-box>
          <p><strong>Test cases can be determined based on the specification, reviewing similar existing systems, or comparing to the past behavior of the SUT.</strong></p>
          <panel header="%%Other details a test case can contain :two:%%" type="seamless">
            <p>A more elaborate test case can have other details such as those given below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A unique identifier : <span class="dimmed">e.g. TC0034-a</span></li>
              <li>A descriptive name: <span class="dimmed">e.g. vertical scrollbar activation for long web pages</span></li>
              <li>Objectives: <span class="dimmed">e.g. to check whether the vertical scrollbar is correctly activated when a long web page is loaded to the browser</span></li>

          <p></p>
          <p>For each test case we do the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Feed the input to the SUT</li>
            <li>Observe the actual output</li>
            <li>Compare actual output with the expected output</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>A test case <em>failure</em> is a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior. A failure is caused by a <em>defect</em> (or a bug).</strong></p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>📦 Example: In the browser example above, a test case failure is implied if the scrollbar remains disabled after loading ‘longfile.html’. The defect/bug causing that failure could be an uninitialized variable.</p>

              <li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
              <li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li>

          <p><strong>A stub has the same interface as the collaborator it replaces, but its implementation is meant to be so simple that it cannot have any bugs. It mimics the responses of the collaborating object, but only for the inputs used for testing.</strong>            That is, it does not know how to respond to any other inputs. These mimicked responses are hard-coded in the stub rather than computed or retrieved from elsewhere, e.g. from a database.</p>

          <p>In <em>Integration testing</em> we test whether different parts of the software ‘work together’ (i.e. integrates) as expected. Here, we assume the individual parts have been unit tested already. Therefore, integration tests aim to discover bugs
            in the ‘glue code’ that are often the result of misunderstanding of what the parts are supposed to do vs what the parts are actually doing. For example let us assume a class <code>Car</code> users classes <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First, we should unit test <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.</li>
            <li>Next, we should unit test <code>Car</code> in isolation of <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>, using stubs for <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.</li>
            <li>After that, we can do an integration test for <code>Car</code> using it together with the <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code> classes to ensure the <code>Car</code> integrates properly with the <code>Engine</code> and the <code>Wheel</code>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the example above, if the <code>Car</code> class assumed a <code>Wheel</code> can support 200 mph speed but the <code>Wheel</code> can only support 150 mph, it is the integration test that is supposed to uncover this discrepancy.</p>

          <p>In system testing we take the <em>whole system</em> and test it <em>against the system specification</em>.</p>
          <p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
          <p>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system. Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails ‘gracefully’ having pushed beyond its
            limits.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Take the example of an SUT (software under test) that is a browser capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. A test case can involve loading a web page containing more than 5000 characters. The expected ‘graceful’ behavior
              would be to ‘abort the loading of the page and show a meaningful error message’. This test case would fail if the browser attempted to load the large file anyway and crashed.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>System testing includes testing against non-functional requirements too. Here are some examples.</p>
          <ul>

            <li><em>Compatibility testing, interoperability testing</em> – to check whether the system can work with other systems.</li>

          <p>At first it might seem logical to have the system built in its entirety first and then getting it tested by professional testers. Here are the downsides of that approach.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space; in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due to multiple inter-related
              bugs.</li>
            <li>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification (i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements).</li>
            <li>One bug might 'hide' other bugs, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
            <li>Too many bugs found during system testing can lead to delivery delays.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Due to the above reasons, it is better to do early developers testing. In fact, there is a widely accepted rule of thumb that says <em>the earlier a bug is found, the easier and cheaper to have it fixed</em>, as illustrated by the graph below.</p>

          <p>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Scripted testing: First write a set of test cases based on the system specification, perform the test cases.</li>
            <li>Exploratory testing: Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’
            <trigger for="pop:bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>            because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing is also known as <em>reactive testing, error guessing technique, attack-based testing,</em> and <em>bug hunting</em>. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas
            identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where more faults are found. For example,</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works,
              even if x doesn’t work. Now, if feature y doesn’t work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...”</p>

          <p>So which approach is better – scripted or exploratory?</p>
          <p>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition. Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled or inexperienced
            testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means
            of testing a critical system.</p>
          <p>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar systems.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations
              benefit from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Requirement Specification vs System Specification</strong></p>
            <p>The requirement specification need not be the same as the system specification. Some example differences:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Requirements specification could be limited to how the system behaves in normal working conditions while the system specification can also include details on how it will fail gracefully when pushed beyond limits, how to recover,</li>
              <li>System specification could contain additional APIs not available for users (for the use of developers/testers), etc • Requirement specification could be written in terms of problems that need to be solved (e.g. provide a method to locate
                an email quickly) while the system specification could be written in terms of how the system solve those problems (e.g. explain the email search feature).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, in many cases one document serves as both a requirement specification and a system specification.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance of testing on the deployment environment</strong></p>
            <p>A system could work perfectly on the development environment, but fail in the deployment environment due to subtle differences between the two.</p>

                <p>A CLI program takes input from keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> operators.
                  For example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in the DOS prompt, the output will be shown in the console. But if you run it like this</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
                <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. Program output using <code>System.out.println</code> is directed to the console by default. When
                  you add <code>&gt; output.txt</code>, the OS redirects the output to <code>output.txt</code> instead. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code> (or any other filename) makes the OS redirect the contents
                  of the file as input to the program.</p>

          <p>If a software product has a GUI component, all product-level testing (i.e. the types of testing mentioned above) need to be done using the GUI. However, testing the GUI is much harder than testing the CLI (command line interface) or API, for
            the following reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Most GUIs contain a large number of different operations, many of which can be performed in any arbitrary order.</li>
            <li>GUI operations are more difficult to automate than API testing. Reliably automating GUI operations and automatically verifying whether the GUI behaves as expected is harder than calling an operation and comparing its return value with an expected
              value. Therefore, automated regression testing of GUIs is rather difficult. However, there are testing tools that can automate GUI testing. For example, TestFx and support automated testing of JavaFX GUIs and Selenium (<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">http://seleniumhq.org/</a>)
              can be used to automate testing of Web application UIs. VisualStudio supports ‘record replay’ type of GUI test automation.</li>
            <li>The appearance of a GUI (and sometimes even behavior) can be different across platforms and even environments. For example, a GUI can behave differently based on whether it is minimized or maximized, in focus or out of focus, and in a high
              resolution display or a low resolution display.</li>
          </ul><img src="/se-book/testing/testAutomation/testingGuis/images/diagram.png" height="120">
          <p></p>
          <p>One approach to overcome the challenges of testing GUIs is to minimize logic aspects in the GUI. Then, bypass the GUI to test the rest of the system using automated API testing. While this still requires the GUI to be tested manually, the number
            of such manual test cases can be reduced as most of the system has been tested using automated API testing.</p>

          <p>In the context of testing, coverage is a metric used to measure the extent to which testing exercises the code.</p>
          <p>Here are some examples of different coverage criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Function/method coverage</strong> measures the coverage in terms of functions executed e.g. testing executed 90 out of 100 functions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Statement coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of the number of line of code executed e.g. testing executed 23k out of 25k LOC.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Decision/branch coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of decision points e.g. an if statement evaluated to both true and false with separate test cases during testing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Condition coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of boolean sub-expressions, each evaluated to both true and false with different test cases. Condition coverage is not the same as the decision coverage; e.g. if(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp;
                x &lt; 44) is considered one decision point but two conditions. For 100% branch or decision coverage, two test cases are required:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == true : [e.g. x = 4]</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == false : [e.g. x = 100]</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>For 100% condition coverage, three test cases are required</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>(x &gt; 2) == true , (x &lt; 44) == true : [e.g. x = 4]</li>
                    <li>(x &lt; 44) == false : [e.g. x = 100]</li>
                    <li>(x &gt; 2) == false : [e.g. x = 0]</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Path coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible paths through a given part of the code executed. 100% path coverage means all possible paths have been executed. A commonly used notation for path analysis is called the
                <em>Control Flow Graph (CFG)</em>. For an introduction to CFGs, refer to the side-note below.</p>
            </li>

            behavior. While TDD has its fair share of detractors, there are many who consider it a good way to reduce defects.</p>

          <p>Testing all possible ways of using an SUT often requires an infinite number of test cases. Except for trivial SUTs, exhaustive testing is not practical.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Consider the test cases for adding a String object to a Collection:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add an item to an empty collection.</li>
              <li>Add an item when there is one item in the collection.</li>
              <li>Add an item when there are 2, 3, .... n items in the collection.</li>
              <li>Add an item that has an English, a French, a Spanish, … word.</li>
              <li>Add an item that is the same as an existing item.</li>
              <li>Add an item immediately after adding another item.</li>
              <li>Add an item immediately after system startup.</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Exhaustive testing of this operation can take many more test cases.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!</p>
            <p>--Edsger Dijkstra</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Every test case adds to the cost of testing. In some systems, a single test case can cost thousands of dollars (e.g. on-field testing of flight-control software). Therefore, test cases have to be designed to make the best use of testing resources.
            In particular:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Testing should be effective, i.e. it finds a high % of existing bugs. A set of test cases that finds 60 defects is more effective than a set that finds only 30 defects in the same system.</li>
            <li>Testing should be efficient, i.e. it has a high rate of success (bugs found/test cases). A set of 20 test cases that finds 8 defects is more efficient than another set of 40 test cases that finds the same 8 defects.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For testing to be E&amp;E, each new test we add should be targeting a potential fault that is not already targeted by existing test cases. There are test case design techniques that can help us improve E&amp;E (Effectiveness and Efficiency)
            of testing. E.g. Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis</p>

          <p>Test case design is said to be following, a categorization based on how much of SUT internal details are considered when designing test cases.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Black-box</em> (aka <em>specification-based or responsibility-based</em>) approach: test cases are designed exclusively based on the SUT’s specified external behavior.</li>
            <li><em>White-box</em> (aka <em>glass-box or structured or implementation-based</em>) approach: test cases are designed based on what is known about the SUT’s implementation, i.e. the code.</li>
            <li><em>Gray-box</em> approach: test case design uses <em>some</em> important information about the implementation. For example, if the implementation of a sort operation uses an algorithm to sort lists shorter than 1000 items and another to sort
              lists longer than 1000 items, more meaningful test cases can then be added to verify the correctness of both algorithms.</li>

            <li>Description: checks if <code>m</code> is in the range [1..12]. returns <code>true</code> if <code>m</code> is in the range, <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is inefficient and impractical to test this method for all integer values <code>[-MIN_INT to MAX_INT]</code>. Fortunately, there is no need to test all possible input values. For example, if the input value <code>233</code> failed to produce
            the correct result, the input <code>234</code> is likely to fail too; there is no need to test both.</p>
          <p>In general, most SUTs do not treat each input in a unique way. Instead, they process all possible inputs in a small number of distinct ways. That means a range of inputs is treated the same way inside the SUT.</p>

          <p>Equivalence partitions (EPs) are usually derived from the specifications of the SUT. Preconditions and postconditions can also help in identifying partitions. For example, these could be EPs for the isValidMonth example:</p>

            <p>Note that if the glass-box or the grey-box approach is used, other associated objects that are involved in the operation might also be included as participants. For example, Minefield object can be considered as another participant of the

            <p>Next, let us identify equivalence partitions for each participant. Will the <code>newGame</code> operation behave differently for different <code>Logic</code> objects? If yes, how will it differ? In this case, yes, it might behave differently

            <ul>

            <p>Consider the Logic component of the Minesweeper application. What are the EPs for the <code>markCellAt(int x, int y)</code> operation?. The partitions in <strong>bold</strong> represent valid inputs.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Logic: PRE_GAME, <strong>READY</strong>, <strong>IN_PLAY</strong>, WON, LOST</li>
              <li>x: [MIN_INT..-1] <strong>[0..(W-1)]</strong> [W..MAX_INT] (we assume a minefield size of WxH)</li>
              <li>y: [MIN_INT..-1] <strong>[0..(H-1)]</strong> [H..MAX_INT]</li>
              <li>Cell at (x,y): <strong>HIDDEN</strong>, MARKED, CLEARED</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A test case for the push operation can be a combination of the equivalence partitions. Given below is such a test case.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>id: DataStack_Push_001</li>
              <li>description: checks whether pushing onto a full stack works correctly</li>
              <li>input: ds is full, o!=null, FREEZE==false</li>
              <li>expected output: returns false, ds remains unchanged</li>

          <p>Note that the EP technique is merely a heuristic and not an exact science, especially when applied manually (as opposed to using an automated program analysis tool to derive EPs). The partitions derived depend on how one ‘speculates’ the SUT
            to behave internally. Applying EP under a glass-box or gray-box approach can yield more precise partitions.</p>

        <div>
          <p><em>Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)</em> is another heuristic that can enhance the E&amp;E of test cases designed using equivalence partitioning. It is based on the observation that bugs often result from incorrect handling of boundaries of equivalence
            partitions. This is not surprising, as the end points of the boundary are often used in branching instructions etc. where the programmer can make mistakes.</p>
          <p>E.g. <code>markCellAt(int x, int y)</code> operation could contain code such as if <code>(x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; = (W-1))</code> which involves boundaries of x’s equivalence partitions.</p>
          <p>BVA suggests that when picking test inputs from an equivalence partition, values near boundaries (i.e. boundary values) should be included.</p>
          <p>Boundary values are sometimes called corner cases.</p>

          <p>For the calculateGrade scenario above, one obvious solution is to test all possible combinations i.e. test all 6x5x2x6=360 cases. Naturally, this technique has a higher chance of discovering bugs (i.e. effective) but the number of combinations
            can be too high to test (i.e. not efficient).</p>
          <p>Therefore, we need smarter ways to combine test inputs that are both effective and efficient.</p>

          <p><strong>c) all pairs</strong>: This strategy creates test cases so that for any given pair of parameters, all combinations between them are tested. It is based on the observations that a bug is rarely the result of more than two interacting
            factors. The resulting number of test cases is lower than the “all combinations” approach, but higher than the “at least once” approach.</p>

          <p>It looks like the test cases were created using the ‘at least once’ strategy. After running these tests can we confirm that square-format label printing is done correctly? Answer: No. Reason: <code>Cherry</code> -- the only input that can produce
            a square-format label -- is in a negative test case which produces an error message instead of a label. If there is a bug in the code that prints labels in square-format, these tests cases will not trigger that bug.</p>
          <p>In this case a useful heuristic to apply is ‘each valid input at least once in a positive test case’ which means exactly what it says. <code>Cherry</code> is a valid test input and we must ensure that it appears at least once in a valid test
            case. Here are the updated test cases after applying that heuristic.</p>

          <p>After running these test cases can we be sure that the error message “invalid price” is shown for negative prices? Answer: No. Reason: <code>-1</code> -- the only input that is a negative price – is in a test case that produces the error message
            “invalid fruit”.</p>
          <p>In this case a useful heuristic to apply is ‘no more than one invalid input in a test case’. After applying that, we get the following test cases.</p>

          <p>Next, let us assume that there is a dependency between the inputs examScore and isAbsent such that an absent student can only have examScore=0. To cater for the hidden invalid case arising from this, we can add a new test case where isAbsent=true
            and examScore!=0. In addition, test cases 3-6.2 should have isAbsent=false so that the input remains valid.</p>

          <p>Use case testing is straightforward in principle: test cases are simply based on the use cases. It is used for system testing (i.e. testing the system as a whole). For example, the main success scenario can be one test case while each variation
            (due to extensions) can form another test case. However, note that use cases do not specify the exact data entered into the system. Instead, it might say something like “user enters his personal data into the system”. Therefore, the tester
            has to choose data by considering equivalence partitions and boundary values. The combinations of these could result in one use case producing many test cases.</p>
          <p>To increase E&amp;E of testing, high-priority use cases are given more attention. For example, a scripted approach can be used to test high priority test cases, while an exploratory approach is used to test other areas of concern that could
            emerge during testing.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Revision Control Software (RCS)</em> are the software tools that automate the process of <em>Revision Control</em> i.e. managing revisions of software artifacts.</strong></p>
          <p>Revision control is also known as <em>Version Control Software (VCS)</em>, and a few other names. Here, we use the terms <em>revision</em> and <em>version</em> interchangeably.</p>
          <tabs>
            <tab header=":abc:">
              <blockquote>
                <p><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information. In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains
                  a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
                <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single
                  user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control
                  tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
                <p>There are a number of reasons why you or your team might want to use an automated revision control tool for a project. It will track the history and evolution of your project, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of
                  who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
                <p>When you're working with other people, <strong>revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong>. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help
                  you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
                <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help
                  you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
                <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself,
                  or with a hundred other people.</p>

          <p><strong>Remote repositories are copies of a repo that are hosted on remote computers.</strong> They are especially useful for sharing the revision history of a codebase among team members of a multi-person project. <span class="dimmed">They can also serve as a remote backup of your code base.</span></p>
          <p><strong>You can <mark><em>clone</em></mark> a remote repo onto your computer</strong> which will create a copy of a remote repo on your computer, including the version history as the remote repo.</p>
          <p><strong>You can <mark><em>push</em></mark> new commits in your clone to the remote repo</strong> which will copy the new commits onto the remote repo. Note that pushing to a remote repo requires you to have write-access to it.</p>
          <p><strong>You can <mark><em>pull</em></mark> from the remote repos to receive new commits in the remote repo</strong>. Pulling is used to <em>sync</em> your local repo with latest changes to the remote repo.</p>
          <p>While it is possible to set up your own remote repo on a server, an easier option is to use a remote repo hosting service such as GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
          <p><strong>A <mark><em>fork</em></mark> is a remote copy of a remote repo</strong>. If there is a remote repo that you want to push to but you do not have write access to it, you can fork the remote repo, which gives you your own remote repo that
            you can push to.</p>
          <p><strong>A <mark><em>pull request</em></mark> is mechanism for contributing code to a remote repo.</strong> It is a formal request sent to the maintainers of the repo asking them to pull your new code to their repo.</p>

          <p>Branching is the process of evolving multiple versions of the software in parallel. For example, one team member can create a new branch and add an experimental feature to it while the rest of the team keeps working on another branch. Branches
            can be given names e.g. <code>master</code><code>release</code><code>dev</code>. A branch can be <em>merged</em> to another branch. Merging usually result in a new commit that represents the combination of the changes done in the two branches.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Merge conflicts</em></strong> happen when you try to merge two branches that had changed the same part of the code and the RCS software cannot decide which changes to keep. In those cases we have to ‘resolve’ those conflicts manually.</p>

          <p>There are two models that can be followed when using an RCS in a team setting: the <em>centralized</em> model and the <em>distributed</em> model.</p>
          <p><strong>Centralized RCS</strong> (CRCS for short): In this model, there is a central remote repo shared by the team. Team members download (‘pull’) and upload (‘push’) changes between their own local repositories and the central repository.
            Older RCS tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model. Note that these older RCS do not support the notion of a local repo. Instead, they force users to do all the versioning with the remote repo.</p>
          <pic src="/se-book/revisionControl/drcsVsCrcs/images/crcsDiagram.png"
            height="180"><strong>The centralized RCS approach without any local repos (e.g., CVS, SVN)</strong></pic>
          <p>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS): In this model, there can be multiple remote repos and pulling and pushing can be done among them in arbitrary ways. The workflow can vary differently from team to team. For example,
            every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support distributed RCS.</p>

          <p>The ‘official’ version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the ‘main repo’. All team members fork the main repo and clone it to their local computer.</p>
          <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fix the bug in that branch.</li>
            <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
            <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
            <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
            <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
            <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated ‘maintainer’ of the main repo) merge the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
            <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, syncs their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
            <li>Ravi clones Adam’s remote repo to his computer. As a result, Ravi now has a local repo with Adam’s code in it.</li>

          <p>When managing projects it is useful to divide the total work into smaller, well-defined units. Relatively complex tasks can be further split into subtasks. A structure that depicts the above information about tasks and their details in terms
            of subtasks is known as a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). In complex projects a WBS can also include prerequisite tasks and effort estimates for each task.</p>
          <p>For the Minesweeper example, the high level tasks for a single iteration could look like the following:</p>

          <p>The effort is traditionally measured in <em>man hour/day/month</em> i.e. work that can be done by one person in one hour/day/month. The <em>Task ID</em> is a label for easy reference to a task. Simple labeling is suitable for a small project,
            while a more informative labeling system can be adopted for bigger projects.</p>

          <p>A milestone is the end of a stage which indicates a significant progress. For example, each intermediate product release is a milestone. We should take into account dependencies and priorities when deciding on the features to be delivered at
            a certain milestone.</p>
          <p>In some projects, it is not practical to have a very detailed plan for the whole project due to the uncertainty and unavailability of required information. In such cases, we can use a high-level plan for the whole project and a detailed plan
            for the next few weeks.</p>

          <p>Given below are three commonly used team structures in software development. Irrespective of the team structure, it is a good practice to assign roles and responsibilities to different team members so that someone is clearly in charge of each
            aspect of the project. In comparison, the ‘everybody is responsible for everything’ approach can result in more chaos and hence slower progress.</p><img src="/se-book/teamwork/teamStructures/images/diagram.png" height="150">
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Egoless team</strong></p>
          <p>In this structure, every team member is equal in terms of responsibility and accountability. When any decision is required, consensus must be reached. This team structure is also known as a democratic team structure. This team structure usually
            finds a good solution to a relatively hard problem as all team members contribute ideas.</p>
          <p>However, the democratic nature of the team structure bears a higher risk of falling apart due to the absence of an authority figure to manage the team and resolve conflicts.</p>
          <p><strong>Chief programmer team</strong></p>
          <p>Frederick Brooks proposed that software engineers learn from the medical surgical team in an operating room. In such a team, there is always a chief surgeon, assisted by experts in other areas. Similarly, in a chief programmer team structure,
            there is a single authoritative figure, the chief programmer. Major decisions, e.g. system architecture, are made solely by him/her and obeyed by all other team members. The chief programmer directs and coordinates the effort of other team
            members. When necessary, the chief will be assisted by domain specialists e.g. business specialists, database expert, network technology expert, etc. This allows individual group members to concentrate solely on the areas where they have sound
            knowledge and expertise.</p>
          <p>The success of such a team structure relies heavily on the chief programmer. Not only must he be a superb technical hand, he also needs good managerial skills. Under a suitably qualified leader, such a team structure is known to produce successful
            work. .</p>
          <p><strong>Strict hierarchy team</strong></p>
          <p>In the opposite extreme of an egoless team, a strict hierarchy team has a strictly defined organization among the team members, reminiscent of the military or bureaucratic government. Each team member only works on his assigned tasks and reports
            to a single “boss”.</p>
          <p>In a large, resource-intensive, complex project, this could be a good team structure to reduce communication overhead.</p>

          <p>The <em>sequential model</em>, also called the <em>waterfall</em> model, models software development as a linear process, in which the project is seen as progressing steadily in one direction through the development stages. The name <em>waterfall</em>            stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/introduction/sequentialModels/images/diagram.png" height="180">
          <p></p>
          <p>When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage. For example, upon completion of the requirement stage a comprehensive list of requirements is produced that will see no further modifications.
            A strict application of the sequential model would require each stage to be completed before starting the next.</p>
          <p>This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable. In such cases, using the sequential model should result in a timely and systematic development effort, provided that all goes well. As each stage has
            a well-defined outcome, the progress of the project can be tracked with a relative ease.</p>
          <p>The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and keep changing over time. One reason for this is that users are generally not aware of how a software application can
            be used without prior experience in using a similar application.</p>

          <p>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC. Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement gathering
            to testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/introduction/iterativeModels/images/diagram.png" height="300">
          <p></p>
          <p>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product. Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable version
            from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.</p>
          <p>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>breadth-first: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.</li>
            <li>depth-first: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The breadth-first approach is considered purely ‘iterative’, while depth-first is ‘incremental’. As mentioned before, most project use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations. Hence, the common phrase ‘an iterative and incremental
            process’.</p>

          <p>In 2001, a group of prominent software engineering practitioners met and brainstormed for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes that were used in most large projects at the time. This resulted in
            something called the <em>agile manifesto</em> (a vision statement of what they were looking to do). The agile manifesto (taken from <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a>) is given below.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
            <p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
              <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
              <li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
              <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Subsequently, some of the signatories of the manifesto went on to create process models that try to follow it. These processes are collectively called agile processes. Some of the key features of agile approaches are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Requirements are prioritized based on the needs of the user, are clarified regularly (at times almost on a daily basis) with the entire project team, and are factored into the development schedule as appropriate.</li>
            <li>Instead of doing a very elaborate and detailed design and a project plan for the whole project, the team works based on a rough project plan and a high level design that evolves as the project goes on.</li>
            <li>Strong emphasis on complete transparency and responsibility sharing among the team members. The team is responsible together for the delivery of the product. Team members are accountable, and regularly and openly share progress with each other
              and with the user.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are a number of agile processes in the development world today. eXtreme Programming (XP) and Scrum are two of the well-known ones.</p>

            <p>The first Extreme Programming project was started March 6, 1996. Extreme Programming is one of several popular Agile Processes. Extreme Programming (XP) stresses customer satisfaction. Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want
              on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it. XP aims to empower developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements, even late in the life cycle.</p>
            <p>XP emphasizes teamwork. Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. XP implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around the problem
              to solve it as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p>XP aims to improve a software project in five essential ways: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage. Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design simple
              and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. Every small success deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every team member. With this foundation, Extreme Programmers are able to courageously
              respond to changing requirements and technology.</p>
            <p>XP has a set of simple rules. XP is a lot like a jig saw puzzle with many small pieces. Individually the pieces make no sense, but when combined together a complete picture can be seen. This flow chart shows how Extreme Programming's rules
              work together.</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/exampleProcessModels/xp/images/diagram.png" height="200">

          <p>This description of Scrum was adapted from Wikipedia [retrieved on 18/10/2011]:</p>
          <tip-box>
            Scrum is a process skeleton that contains sets of practices and predefined roles. The main roles in Scrum are:
            <ul>
              <li>The ScrumMaster, who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a project manager)</li>
              <li>The Product Owner, who represents the stakeholders and the business</li>
              <li>The Team, a cross-functional group who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A Scrum project is divided into iterations called Sprints. A sprint is the basic unit of development in Scrum. Sprints tend to last between one week and one month, and are a timeboxed (i.e. restricted to a specific duration) effort of a constant
              length.</p>
            <p>Each sprint is preceded by a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made, and followed by a review or retrospective meeting, where the progress is reviewed and lessons
              for the next sprint are identified.</p>
            <p>During each sprint, the team creates a potentially deliverable product increment (for example, working and tested software). The set of features that go into a sprint come from the product backlog, which is a prioritized set of high level
              requirements of work to be done. Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the Product Owner informs the team of the items in the product backlog that he or she wants completed.
              The team then determines how much of this they can commit to complete during the next sprint, and records this in the sprint backlog. During a sprint, no one is allowed to change the sprint backlog, which means that the requirements are
              frozen for that sprint. Development is timeboxed such that the sprint must end on time; if requirements are not completed for any reason they are left out and returned to the product backlog. After a sprint is completed, the team demonstrates
              the use of the software.</p>
            <p>Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members, and verbal communication between all team members and disciplines in the project.</p>
            <p>A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements churn), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional
              predictive or planned manner. As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team’s ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.</p>
            <p>Like other agile development methodologies, Scrum can be implemented through a wide range of tools. Many companies use universal software tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also
              open-source and proprietary software packages dedicated to management of products under the Scrum process. Other organizations implement Scrum without the use of any software tools, and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as
              paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes. The diagram below illustrates the essence of the Scrum process.</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/exampleProcessModels/scrum/images/diagram.png" height="250">

          <p>Given above is a visualization of a project done using the Unified process (source: Wikipedia). As the diagram shows, a phase can consist of several iterations. Each vertical column (labeled “I1” “E1”, “E2”, “C1”, etc.) represents a single iteration.
            Each of the iterations consists of a set of ‘workflows’ such as ‘Business modeling’, ‘Requirements’, ‘Analysis &amp; Design’ etc. The shaded region indicates the amount of resource and effort spent on a particular workflow in a particular
            iteration.</p>
          <p>Note that the unified process is a flexible and customizable process model framework rather than a single fixed process. For example, the number of iterations in each phase, definition of workflows, and the intensity of a given workflow in a
            given iteration can be adjusted according to the nature of the project. Take the Construction Phase, to develope a simple system, one or two iterations would be sufficient. For a more complicated system, multiple iterations will be more helpful.
            Therefore, the diagram above simply records a particular application of the UP rather than prescribe how the UP is to be applied. However, this record can be refined and reused for similar future projects.</p>

            <p>CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is a process improvement approach defined by Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Melon University. CMMI provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes, which will
              improve their performance. CMMI-based process improvement includes identifying an organization’s process strengths and weaknesses and making process changes to turn weaknesses into strengths.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>CMMI defines five maturity levels for a process and provides criteria to determine if the process of an organization is at a certain maturity level. The diagram below [taken from Wikipedia] gives an overview of the five levels.</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/more/cmmi/images/diagram.png"

          <ul>
            <li>0..1 : optional, can be linked to 0 or 1 objects</li>

          <p>An attribute is sometimes used to represent an association. The diagram below depicts a multiplayer <em>Square Game</em> being played on a board comprising of one hundred squares. Each of the squares may be occupied with any number of Pieces,
            each belonging to a certain player. A piece may or may not be on a square. Note how the association <code>’is on’</code> can be replaced by an <code>isOn</code> attribute of the <code>Piece</code> class. In order to realize the 0..1 multiplicity,
            the isOn attribute can either be null or hold a reference to a Square object.</p>

          <p>Compared to the notation for a class diagrams, object diagrams differ in the following ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instance name may be shown</li>
            <li>There is a <code>:</code> before the class name</li>
            <li>Instance and class names are underlined</li>
            <li>Methods are omitted</li>
            <li>Multiplicities are omitted</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Both object diagrams are derived from the same class diagram shown earlier. In other words, each of these object diagrams shows ‘an instance of’ the same class diagram.</p>

              <p>Now, we need to create the <em>main Java class</em> that starts up our application with the <code>RootLayout.fxml</code> and adds the <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code> in the center.</p>
              <p>Right-click on your <code>seedu.address</code> package, and choose <code>New</code> → <code>JavaFXApplication</code>. For the class name, type <code>MainApp</code>.</p>
              <p>The generated <code>MainApp.java</code> class extends from <code>Application</code> and contains two methods. This is the basic structure that we need to start a JavaFX Application. The most important part for us is the <code>start(Stage primaryStage)</code>                method. It is automatically called when the application is <code>launch()</code> from within the <code>main()</code> method.</p>
              <p>As you see, the <code>start(...)</code> method receives a <code>Stage</code> as parameter. The following graphic illustrates the structure of every JavaFX application:</p><img src="/se-book/javaTools/javaFXBasic/part01/images/javafx-hierarchy.png"

              <p><em>It's like a theater play:</em> The <code>Stage</code> is the main container which is usually a <code>Window</code> with a border and the typical minimize, maximize and close buttons. Inside the <code>Stage</code> you add a <code>Scene</code>                which can, of course, be switched out by another <code>Scene</code>. Inside the <code>Scene</code> the actual JavaFX nodes like <code>AnchorPane</code>, <code>TextBox</code>, etc. are added.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>With JavaFX, it is common to use <code>*Property</code> for all fields of a model class. A <code>Property</code> allows us, for example, to automatically be notified when the <code>lastName</code> or any other variable is changed. This
                  helps us keep the view in sync with the data.</li>
                <li>To learn more about <code>*Property</code>, refer to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/properties-binding-tutorial/binding.htm">Using JavaFX Properties and Binding</a></li>
                <li><code>LocalDate</code>, the type that we are using for <code>birthday</code>, is part of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/">new Date and Time API for JDK 8</a></li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="a-list-of-persons">A List of Persons</h2>
              <p>The main data that our application manages is simply a bunch of persons. Let's create a list of <code>Person</code> objects inside the <code>MainApp</code> class. All other controller classes will later get access to that central list inside
                the <code>MainApp</code>.</p>
              <h3 id="observablelist">ObservableList</h3>
              <p>We are working with JavaFX view classes that need to be informed about any changes made to the list of persons. This is important, since otherwise the view would not be in sync with the data. For this purpose, JavaFX introduces some new
                <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/collections-tutorial/collections.htm">Collection classes</a>.</p>
              <p>Among all these collections, we need the <code>ObservableList</code>. To create a new <code>ObservableList</code>, add the following code at the beginning of the <code>MainApp</code> class. We'll also add a constructor that creates some
                sample data and a public getter method:</p>

              <h2 id="the-personoverviewcontroller">The PersonOverviewController</h2>
              <p>We have our model and view. Let's get our data into our table. We'll need a controller for our <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code> to act as a &quot;middleman&quot; for the model and view.</p>
              <p>Create a normal Java class inside the <code>view</code> package called <code>PersonOverviewController</code>.</p>
              <tip-box type="tip">
                <p>Note: We must put the class inside the same package as <code>PersonOverview.fxml</code>, otherwise the SceneBuilder won't be able to find it.</p>
              </tip-box>
              <p>We will add some instance variables that give us access to the table and the labels inside the view. The fields and some methods have a special <code>@FXML</code> annotation. This is necessary in order for the <code>.fxml</code> file to
                have access to private fields and private methods. After we have everything set up in the <code>.fxml</code> file, the application will automatically fill the variables when the <code>.fxml</code> file is loaded.</p>
              <p>So let's add the following code:</p>

                <li>The <code>initialize()</code> method is automatically called after the <code>.fxml</code> file has been loaded. At this time, all the FXML fields should have been initialized already.</li>
                <li>The <code>setCellValueFactory(...)</code> that we set on the table colums are used to determine which field inside the <code>Person</code> objects should be used for the particular column. The arrow <code>-&gt;</code> indicates that we're
                  using a Java 8 feature called Lambdas. (Another option would be to use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/"><code>PropertyValueFactory</code></a>, but this is not type-safe).</li>

                <p>Note:</p>
                <p>We're only using <code>StringProperty</code> values for our table columns in this example. When you want to use <code>IntegerProperty</code> or <code>DoubleProperty</code>, the <code>setCellValueFactory(...)</code> must have an additional

            </div>
          </tip-box>
          <p>In other words, if a program module is using a super class, then the reference to the super class can be replaced with a sub class without affecting the functionality of the program module.</p>
          <p>As we know, Java already allows substituting objects of sub classes where an object of the super class is expected. However, that does not mean that doing so will not break the functionality of the code. To follow LSP, we should be careful not
            to contradict the behavior specified by the super class.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/principles/liskovSubstitutionPrinciple/images/payroll.png" height="200">
            <p></p>
            <p>Suppose the <code>Payroll</code> class depends on the <code>adjustMySalary(int percent)</code> method of the <code>Staff</code> class. Furthermore, the <code>Staff</code> class states that the <code>adjustMySalary</code> method will work for
              all positive percent values. Both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> classes override the <code>adjustMySalary</code> method. Now consider the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Admin#adjustMySalary</code> method works for both negative and positive percent values.</li>
              <li><code>Academic#adjustMySalary</code> method works for percent values 1..100 only.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the above scenario,</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Admin</code> class follows LSP because it fulfills <code>Payroll</code>’s expectation of <code>Staff</code> objects (i.e. it works for all positive values). Substituting <code>Admin</code> objects for Staff objects will not break the
                <code>Payroll</code> class functionality.</li>
              <li><code>Academic</code> class violates LSP because it will not work for percent values over 100 as expected by the <code>Payroll</code> class. Substituting <code>Academic</code> objects for <code>Staff</code> objects can potentially break
                the <code>Payroll</code> class functionality.</li>

              <p><strong>Separation of Concerns Principle (SoC)</strong>: To achieve better modularity, separate the code into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate <em>concern</em>. -- Edsger W. Dijkstra</p>
            </div>
          </tip-box>
          <p>A concern in this context is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.</p>
          <p>Examples for <em>concerns</em>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A specific feature, such as the code related to <code>add employee</code> feature</li>
            <li>A specific aspect, such as the code related to <code>persistence</code> or <code>security</code></li>
            <li>A specific entity, such as the code related to the <code>Employee</code> entity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Applying SoC reduces functional overlaps among code sections and also limits the ripple effect when changes are introduced to a specific part of the system.</p>
          <p>This principle can be applied at the class level, as well as on higher levels. For example, the n-tier architecture utilizes this principle. Each layer in the architecture has a well-defined functionality that has no functional overlap with
            each other. A correct application of this principle should lead to higher cohesion and lower coupling.</p>

          <p>More concretely, a method m of an object O should invoke only the methods of the following kinds of objects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The object <code>O</code> itself</li>
            <li>Objects passed as parameters of <code>m</code></li>
            <li>Objects created/instantiated in <code>m</code></li>
            <li>Objects from the direct association of <code>O</code></li>
          </ul>
          <tip-box>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The following code fragment violates LoD due to the reason: while <code>b</code> is a ‘friend’ of <code>foo</code> (because it receives it as a parameter), <code>g</code> is a ‘friend of a friend’ (which should be considered a ‘stranger’),
              and <code>g.doSomething()</code> is analogous to ‘talking to a stranger’.</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span><span class="hljs-params">(Bar b)</span> </span>{
    Goo g = b.getGoo();
    g.doSomething();
}
</code></pre>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Limiting the interaction to a closely related group of classes aims to reduce coupling. In the example able, <code>foo</code> is already coupled to <code>Bar</code>. Upholding LoD avoids <code>foo</code> being coupled to <code>Goo</code>.</p>
          <p>An analogy for LoD can be drawn from Facebook. If Facebook followed LoD, you would not be allowed to see posts of friends of friends, unless they are your friends as well. If Jake is your friend and Adam is Jake’s friend, you should not be allowed
            to see Adam’s posts unless Adam is a friend of yours as well.</p>
