# Definitions

## A

<div id="def-abstractClass">

**Abstract class**: A class declared as an _abstract class_ cannot be instantiated, but it can be subclassed.

</div>
<div id="def-abstractMethod">

**Abstract method**: An _abstract method_ is a method signature without a method implementation.

</div>

<div id="def-abstraction">

**Abstraction** is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level.

</div>

<div id="def-acceptance-testing">

**_Acceptance testing_ (aka _User Acceptance Testing (UAT)_: test the system to ensure it meets the user requirements.**

</div>

<div id="def-actor">

**Actor**: An actor (in a use case) is a role played by a user.  An actor can be a human or another system. Actors are not part of the system; they reside outside the system.

</div>

<div id="def-architecture">

**Architecture**: The high level structures of a software system, the discipline of creating such structures, and the documentation of these structures. These structures are needed to reason about the software system. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations. The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building.

</div>

## B

<div id="def-brainstorming">

**Brainstorming**: A group activity designed to _generate a large number of diverse and creative ideas_ for the _solution_ of a problem.

</div>

<div id="def-brooks-law">

**Brooks' law**: Adding people to a late project will make it later. -- Fred Brooks (author of _The Mythical Man-Month_)

</div>

## C

<div id="def-camel-case">
<blockquote>

</pic>

_CamelCase_ is named after the "humps" of its capital letters, similar to the humps of a Bactrian camel. Camel case (stylized as `camelCase`) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation.

<small>%%-- adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)%%</small>
</blockquote>

e.g., `createEmptyList`, `listOfIntegers`, `htmlText`, `dvdPlayer`. This book defines camelCase style as requiring the first letter to be lower case. If the first letter is upper case instead e.g., `CreateEmptyList`, it is called _UpperCamelCase_ or _PascalCase_.

</div>

<div id="def-client-code">

**Client component/method/object**: The component/method/object that is interacting with a given code.

</div>

<div id="def-cli">

</div>

## D

<div id="def-dependency-inversion-principle">

**Dependency inversion principle (DIP)**:

1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

<div id="def-design-pattern">

**Design pattern**: An _elegant reusable solution_ to a _commonly recurring problem_ within a _given context_ in software design.

</div>

## P

<div id="def-pair-programming">

<div id="def-revision">

**Revision**: A _revision_ (some seem to use it interchangeably with _version_ while others seem to distinguish the two -- here, let us treat them as the same, for simplicity) is a state of a piece of information at a specific time that is a result of some changes to it %%e.g., if you modify the code and save the file, you have a new revision (or a version) of that file%%.

It mimics the responses of the component, but only for a limited set of predetermined inputs. That is, it does not know how to respond to any other inputs. Typically, these mimicked responses are hard-coded in the stub rather than computed or retrieved from elsewhere, e.g. from a database.

## U

<div id="def-uml">

[**Unified Modeling Language (UML)**](http://www.uml.org/#UML2.0) is a graphical notation to describe various aspects of a software system. UML is the brainchild of three software modeling specialists James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson (also known as the Three Amigos). Each of them had developed their own notation for modeling software systems before joining forces to create a unified modeling language (hence, the term ‘Unified’ in UML). UML is currently the most commonly used modeling notation used in the software industry.
